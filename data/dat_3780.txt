The following review is about the PC version and my experience. It is not about the game content.<br />After reading all the reviews of the PC download versions, I was a bit weary. Seems like a lot of people are having problems with installation. At first, it seemed to install fine. After the mandatory update, it just stuck until timed out. Turned out a lot of people have the same problem according to Google search. I followed the instruction on Rock Star web site and it still didn't work. Finally I found a fan website and it turned out all it needed is to run the patch with administrative right.<br />The PC graphic is awesome! I have played the xBox version and the PC version is better. I max out my graphic card and there are times the graphic is not quite smooth. I overlook those problems since I only pay 5 dollars. I also purchased the downloadable game content via Amazon. The total cost is lower than ordering the complete version!<br />One thing I noticed is the game takes a long time to load. It connects to internet every time I play. I guess it checks to see if it is an illegal copy. Then game then checks for the DLC. It takes a few minutes and there is no way to bypass them! Rock Star should reflect on it. Do you have to authenticate every single time I play?<br />I can't wait to try the DLC. I beat the game once on xBox but it was long time ago. It is nice to see Cole Phelps is back. Hopefully they will make a squeal.
