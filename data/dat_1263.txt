'Stand O'Food' comes across as a time-management games, but in all actuality is a puzzle game instead. Now, I have played a great many programs thus far by Alawar Games, but I have to say that this one was a great disappointment. For one thing, it is almost TOO FAST for gameplay. The graphics look like someone had almost colored the screen with a crayon and then sat back and said 'hey, let's SELL this!'. If you're going to create a program such as this, make it a little more plausible. For instance, make it a little easier to get what you need. I mean, twenty bucks for a coffee pot for your stand is a little ridiculous, considering that you're making pennies on the dollar after each level. While that may be true in real life, this is a GAME! I know there are two more, and maybe I may take the time to check those out. But this one is a real stinker!
