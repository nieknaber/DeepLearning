What a nightmare this game is! I was so thoroughly disappointed. The technical issues were legion.  The rendering in this game was awful. I got to a point where certain machines and animals were completely blacked out - no animation at all. I would have giant black triangles or huge rectangles that covered half the screen. The ground would be blacked out with little lights like a nighttime sky. The animals ran into each other and got stuck. The cats never went over to any items, but stayed in one place. My husband, a programmer, wondered whether any actual beta testing took place on this game. It was a mess. I played to the end because I love to finish Farm Frenzy games. But I don't think I'll be buying another FF though if this is the level of quality they'll be putting out. It repeatedly shut itself down with error messages, and repeatedly shut down my entire computer (I'm not going to list how many times because it makes me sound like a glutton for punishment, but it was A LOT). It was so frustrating and stressful and sucked all the joy out of playing the game.<br /><br />As far as game play goes - this is my favorite type of FF game - it wasn't really puzzles or figuring out how exactly to get something done in order to beat the time, but rather here's the buildings and here's the animals you get, and give me so much of this.  I liked that aspect.  But the rest of the mess made it impossible to fully enjoy the game play.
