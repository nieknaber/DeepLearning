Amazon asks you to review these things so far after your purchase it's nearly impossible to remember but..... I had a problem with this one.<br /><br />I only install games through Steam. I don't do &#34;direct&#34; installs as I would call them. I purchased this pack when the description read<br /><br />&#34;Steam account required for game activation and installation.&#34;<br /><br />To me this meant I had to install all four games through Steam and I was more than okay with this. Well, Manhunt 2 is not available on Steam. I complained about this to Amazon and they offered a full refund. I told them that I only need a partial refund as 3 of the 4 games worked as the description advertised, Amazon is unable to offer partial refunds so they gave me a $5 credit and promised to fix the description.<br /><br />Well, the description has since been fixed. Amazon keeps it's word which is amazing.<br /><br />&#34;Steam account required for game activation and installation except Manhunt 2, which is not available on Steam currently.&#34;<br /><br />This game pack is totally not worth the current asking price of around $50. I got it when it was sub $10 which made it just right.<br /><br />Amazon service 5/5. Game package 3/5.
