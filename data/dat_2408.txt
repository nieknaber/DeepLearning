This is the first game of this type I bought and played. I found it diverting for a while. It looks nice with carefully drawn, crisp and detailed images presented. But I found the logical and narrative structure of the game frustrating most of the time. There were gaps of logic and storytelling that made it hard to be immersed in the experience. Information was often entered in to the journal before it was `discovered' in the game world by reading a newspaper or note for example. There were silly procedures too. For example, at one point you need to put out a fire in a fireplace. You collect a bucket of water, but it won't put out the fire. You have to find a different bucket of water later before you can put out the fire. The game is frequently punctuated by a repetitive mini-game where you are presented with a still scene jumbled with objects, out of which you have to find 16 or so, in order to be given one of those objects which will actually be used in the game. There is no attempt to justify the logic of this pointless object searching game, and after 3 or 4 repetitions it becomes tedious. You are congratulated for coming up with such a great idea for dealing with the last ghost despite not having thought of the idea at all. The `good idea' is all set up neatly for you when you arrive on the scene.<br /><br />The closing story is hurried and disappointing, all too eagerly setting up a sequel without giving any real sense of closure here.<br /><br />So, it's a cheap way of passing a bit of time, but you can get much better and longer games for $5 on Amazon so why bother with this?
