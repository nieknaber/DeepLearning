Okay, so I was super excited to download this even though it had been out for quite awhile before I actually purchased it. I would say the majority of my first playing experience was pretty exciting for me since I love The Sims and can't get enough of new expansion packs. However, I honestly can't say I've replayed the whole university thing more than 3 times. I mostly enjoyed the game the times I've played it and think it's a really fun element to take the sims through if you want to have a more realistic &#34;life-span&#34;. The new objects and features that carry into the base game (when you are just in your regular town) were really what made this expansion pack valuable to me.<br /><br />A major reason that I can't give this the full five stars is that I keep experiencing a really weird glitch when my sims go to actually graduate. My sims either get stuck outside of the building in their cap and gown indefinitely or they never come back out of the building at all! On the times that I have managed to get them graduated and ready to go back home there have still been issues! My sims keep geting stranded in the middle of a field once they move back to town. I've tried resetting them, but nothing seems to work so I've had to completely abandon the save file each time it has happened. Even though I sort of wish there was more to the whole university experience (more interactive classes, more interesting venues) I would probably be more enthusiastic about replaying it if I thought my sims would actually survive graduation! Overall, I think it's worth the money if you're really into the Sims, want something new to play around with and can avoid the weird glitch I ran into.
