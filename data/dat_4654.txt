Addicting game overall. I used to own and have only played tropico 1 before playing this game, and it is much improved. I heard this game would better be suited as an expansion, but I wouldnt know, Ive never payed tropico 3. The missions are cool and take about 3-4 hours each to complete. Fun overall, worth the 40 bucks.
