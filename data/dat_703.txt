As a casual gamer, there are only a handful of platform games that I've truly enjoyed and have had fun playing.  Titles such as iconic Karateka/Prince of Persia, Rayman, Trine, and now, Last Knight.  Make no mistake, however, this short list isn't really hand picked out of a rut of an infinitely scrolling list of platform games.  There's simply not enough of these gems being made for the PC.<br /><br />Doubtlessly 2d/psuedo 3D platform-styled games have been, per the namesake, most conducive to console/mobile platforms due to the ease of controls as well as hardware compatibility / reliance.  As a result, many PC gamers would wistfully, perhaps even resentfully, gawk at treasure troves of fantastic games aimed exclusively for console/mobile gaming.  To appease the PC demographic, many publishing power houses end up aggravating the angst with flimsy, unoptimized ports to the PC platform as feeble DLC after thoughts.  Not so with Last Knight.  Thank goodness Toco Games has bucked that demeaning trend.<br /><br />Say one thing about Last Knight.  Say that Last Knight is an adrenaline boosting, stomach clenching, attention gripping platform game clearly written from the ground up with the PC in mind -- and with spectacularly rewarding results -- worth every ounce of pride for a confident, quality release to the general public.<br /><br />Silky smooth motion, richly rendered, gorgeous environments, thrilling on-screen action, and simple controls all are key ingredients for a great, fun extravaganza which lets Last Knight grab the baton of genre-mastery from its ancestors and gallops off, at break neck speeds into a distant horizon, for a finish that deserves nothing less than a standing ovation -- for an incredible $5.99.
