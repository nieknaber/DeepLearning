this is one of my favorite expansion packs. Ambitions is all about non-rabbit hole jobs and having a real proffesion. for example, the ghost hunting career, you actually go from house to house hunting ghost. ambitions also has the simbot. a simbot can be obtained by buying a special lifetime wish, or you can build them your self when you receive a a special opprutunity at level 10 inventing skill. the Sims 3 ambitions is my favorite expansion pack and i love twinbrook(the town that comes with ambitions).
