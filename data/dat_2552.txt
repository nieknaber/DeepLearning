I enjoy the Sims 3 games. I was ecstatic when I heard that this expansion was coming out. I haven't had the time to play through more than a few seasons, but I love the weather effects. The thunder is realistic, as is the rain. I love it and am so happy with my purchase.<br /><br />It lost a star because of Origin. I purchased the digital download expecting it to be like all the other amazon games I've downloaded. I was somewhat annoyed with the process with Origin. I got the code from amazon, then had to update origin, then remember my account ID and password, and then use the code to download the game. I was seriously annoyed just because it seems so roundabout. I agree with other reviewers - if you don't want to be frustrated with Origin, buy the CDs.
