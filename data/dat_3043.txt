It is a terrific game (but addictive) It would be a great game for schools to use with almost all ages.  It builds vocabulary, encourages reading, is wonderful in developing figure ground visual perception. and the list goes on, it to if I could buy it on a disk or flash disk I would and give it to some of my teacher friends or to some of my nieces and nephews. I guess you can tell that I am impressed with this game.  Congrats to the artist and designers it is a wonderful product.
