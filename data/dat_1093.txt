I love this kind of time management game.  It's definitely the most challenging &#34;Dash&#34; game to me so far.  I would use them to wind down but there's none of that in this game! It gets fast paced very quickly.  I use my laptop to play and I feel like an actual mouse would be very handy, just to let you know.  It has little mini games between each level that I'm not sure how I feel about yet but maybe I'll get used to them, at this point they're just kind of annoying.  Overall, well worth the $6.99.
