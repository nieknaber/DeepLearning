I picked this game up during the Amazon Black Friday sales and thought &#34;why not?&#34; Little did I know how addicting it would be. A word of warning: the game is very involved and you have to manage a TON of things. If you like City Building games like Sim City or Cities XL, you will really enjoy this game. Also, it's got a hint of Civilization to it as well. I am just sad I didn't pick this up earlier. It's amazing how many things there are to do in this game: open trade routes to other islands you own or neighbors own, build cities, construct resources, build specific resources to make money if you want, build military, etc.<br /><br />Highly recommended
