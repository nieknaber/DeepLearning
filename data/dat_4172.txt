This game is different from the first two in the series, although main character is the same. It takes a little time to get used to the \\"illusions\\" mode of seeing things- I suggest using the tutorial. I liked how you have to use the found objects in order  to solve each chapter, sometimes re-visiting each room to accomplish final solution. I will enjoy  re-playing this game. Mini- games were good, and the option to skip them wis useful. Also, unlimited hints were very handy and kept me from getting \\"stuck\\".
