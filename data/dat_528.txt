The game itself is fun, but the PC version is completely broken. The game will rarely run for more than an hour or two before crashing (and it does this for virtually everyone,not just me). It's even worse for those who own Geforce 8800 GT video cards; the game crashes every 20-30 minutes instead for us. Despite the complaints the developers released no patches that fix these problems and since the last patch was over a year and a half ago they likely never will. Save your money and buy the 360 or PS3 version instead.
