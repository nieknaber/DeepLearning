Hopefully when finishing weeding out minor bugs, they will add content because you can finish the 3 cat game at all 3 difficulties in 6 weeks or so (minus the uberpowered endgame which requires 4 very rare map pieces to access).  The character skill system is just as amazing as it is daunting, and almost too complicated.  Your first character is very likely to be a mess, research is absolutely necessary, but there are adequate websights to learn from.  Drop rates for the unique (most useful) items is very sparse for my taste, and after 3 months of daily playing I have yet to find any but minor starter pieces, and the in game economy is amazingly expensive.  That said I appreciate the all the work the designers put into this game, and will continue to patiently grind away 3.5 stars.
