If you like hidden games this game is OK, thus the three star rating. It is not put together as well as some others such as the Scruffs, Gardenscapes, Golden Trails and such. But it is not as expensive as these others and it is fun to search  through various scenes and is enjoyable. Some things are very cleverly hidden. I bought it and will play it occasionally in my collection of games.
