After bouncing around in just about every MMORPG out there, I decided to come back to EQ after reading a review about House of Thule.  I have not been disapointed, much easier to get into now, transition from group content to raiding is much smoother, content is just all around a big improvement.  There is so much to do in this game, it's really overwhelming at first.  The graphics are a bit dated, not bad, they have come a long ways, but graphics aren't everything I have come to find with MMO's.  Pretty graphics are nice, but after spending hours in a game, they only impress for so long.  I would say EQ is still the best MMO out there, there is just an endless amount of things to do, great community, and at max level, you still have a ton to do.  If lack of some of the more modern features really bothers you, this won't be for you, but if you like a huge game world with lots to do, and huge character development, then EQ will still appeal.
