I bought it on sale ($49.99 for 15 months) and have really enjoyed the free games you get with it. The free games are absolutely free and don't expire until your subscription expires.... 15 months, that's definitely enough time for me. And the free games aren't cheap janky ones either, they're pretty good! When I subscribed I immediately downloaded Little Big Planet 2, Infamous 2, Spec Ops the Line, Demon's Souls and cool psn games like Closure and The Cave. They also give you full game trials instead of demos, which I find useful if I'm looking to buy a game.<br /><br />Oh AND... You get Auto-Upload Saved Game to the cloud and Auto-System Update. Two things I think are the best features of ps+ both for convenience and safety.... In case my ps3 lost/stolen/breaks/natural disaster/etc. I'll still have all my saves in the cloud.<br /><br />If you have a 1 free month ps+ trial.... USE IT! See if you like it too! (And then buy a subscription! It's worth it!)
