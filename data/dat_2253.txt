All the whining and complaining you might have had about how EA killed BioWare's masterpiece series is subdued quite a bit with the addition of all the extra DLC. The ability to have a Prothean fight by your side through most of the game is hands down the best part of this deluxe edition. It makes for some fantastic dialogue throughout the game. Also, with the fixed endings of the extended cut DLC, this makes ME3 about as good as ME2 and a good finale to the greatest Action RPG series ever made. At least someone at EA and what's left of the original BioWare team that worked on the series cared enough to give us the best version.
