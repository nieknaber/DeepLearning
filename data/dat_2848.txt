I LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE this game!! But I hate how my day disappears when I play it. OMG just one more turn..... and then another..... and then another..... five hours later..... wasn't I supposed to be doing something?<br /><br />As for the games contents, graphics, playability, system requirements, and improvements needed or what is done right.... well just read all the other reviews. I don't have time for that cause I got to get back to kickin Williams butt!<br /><br />The only thing that made me sad about this purchase is the fact that the price went from $49.99 when I bought it down to like $29.99 literally like 2 days later. This has nothing to do with the quality of the product itself. In fact the redeeming fact is that I've gotten my money's worth several times over with the amount of entertainment that this game gives me. However, while I know Amazon's policy on refunding the difference (i.e. they only do that with t.v.s) it does seem like there should be some limited window that allows if the price drops drastically and just days after your purchase you get some type of  at least 7 days and a certain percentage of the purchase to be credited consolation.
