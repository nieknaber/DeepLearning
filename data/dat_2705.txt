The game is interesting and fun if you are into the kind of simulator it is. It isn't quite what I was hoping for, but I would give the game 4 stars. If you like simulators this game is for you.<br /><br />But then again, because of EA/Amazon, I have access only to offline play.<br /><br />Now, EA and Amazon just don't seem to care about this game, although its likely more EAs fault since Amazon probably has a key database from them. Numerous people have run into the dreaded invalid key issue, and I am one of them. For bobs sake, just replace the method of account authentication to something that can't be so easily generated or cracked (*looks at Spore developers glaring*). You are making the case for piracy more appealing, when DRM prevents people who actually buy a product from being able to use features of it just because someone else has already generated their key using a VB application written by a 12 year old.<br /><br />Anyways, I have emailed both Amazon and EA, and am waiting a response. But this kind of thing, for any product, is not acceptable.
