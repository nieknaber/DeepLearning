everthing downloaded fine, i had no problems getting it started and it loaded up just fine, but when i actually got to the create a pet screen, the dog that was there was completly distorted, it scared the living hell outta me when i first started it and evertime i tried to change it it stayed the same. i dont know what is going on with this demo but if something like this happens with the actual game im going to have a real problem with this.
