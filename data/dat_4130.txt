This is an awesome and fast-paced game from the Total War series. The only problem I have with it is that Sega/Activision whomever does poor product support, which means none for this item. I get about 3/4 of the way through the game and it glitches and I lose everything.<br />I really like the game, but the other side of the product is for garbage.
