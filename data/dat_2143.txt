This is easily my favorite game ever for all systems since Nintendo. I love the multiplayer and play it every day it is four and four and survival combat with two teams you gather supplies on map making Molotovs, better armor, better weapons  and take out the other team. Its brutal and gory Gameplay that is addictive. Also as an owner of the ps3 version this has 1080 p graphics with much improved textures (you can actually read signs now).* Update now has HDR and true 4k for us users of 4k TVs. One of few times with true 4k. And has a cool photo mode that lets you take pictures and apply filters. That says nothing of the 20 hour campaign which I equate as amazing, with a great story and has great character development. The graphics and scenery and variety is astounding, I believe the team that made this had to love resident evil 4 as it has that same tight Gameplay with excellent variety. At 50 dollars this is a steal and at 100 I would still think this is a steal. This will probably be the best ps4 game until the inevitable last of us 2.
