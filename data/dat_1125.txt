Today's date is January 30th, 2014 and episode one came out December 17th 2013.<br /><br />I love this game, but creating an episodic game like this should only be done if the developer is prepared to keep a schedule to release episodes on a somewhat regular basis.  If Telltale was not prepared to release season 2 but wanted to give a holiday treat to fans they should've released an episode that was not intended to kick-off a second season but instead act as a stand-alone episode with a hint at where season 2 will take us.  It's painful to check up on the game week after week and see no new content, I feel like Telltale has left us hanging.<br /><br />I highly recommend getting this game on Steam or PSN once the season has been fully released.  At this pace that could be sometime around September 2014.
