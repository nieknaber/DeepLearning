I bought this game not to long ago and I am very satisfied with the purchase. It is a HUGE step up from the Rome Total War game and there is quite a bit more to do and worry about in this game. Not only are you fighting to conquer the known world and factions surrounding you but you also have to worry about the Pope and his ever watchful eye. There is also, 4 other games that come with the original Medieval game. The Americans, Teutonic, Spanish, and Crusades campaigns. Worth the buy and way easier to handle then having the disk.
