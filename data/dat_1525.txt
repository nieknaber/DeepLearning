haven't run into any of the problems noted in the reviews....some of the micromanaging of power and plumbing that was so annoying in the early versions (SC2000) have become automated.....but it is replaced by complex money / budget management requirements....being able to pause everything and correct issues without having time pass in the background is nice......have not tried to save and reload any city's yet...
