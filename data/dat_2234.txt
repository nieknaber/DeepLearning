Two words: Hardy Boys.  Not exactly what I pictured, but still awesome.  The puzzles are some of the most inventive of the Nancy Drew games.  It's a mystery on a train.  What's not to love?  The characters are all quirky, the graphics are fantastic and the story line is interesting.  I've played a lot of Nancy Drew games, and this ranks among my top 3 favorite.
