I really enjoyed Dragon Age Origins but didn't get DA2 when it came out because of the bad reviews. An alarmingly high percentage of reviewers were overtly upset about how DA2 ruined a masterpiece, some going so far as to describe it as terrible.  In the PC version, for example, over 100 of the 260 reviews are 1 or 2 stars.  I finally bought it at the discounted price of $5.  I haven't finished the game, but here is a quick review while the sale is going on.<br /><br />Strengths:<br />-This game is fun.  I really enjoy the team based mechanic and pausing the game to assign different characters skills.<br />- The story is engaging.<br />- For an average player this is still Dragon Age.  The things that defined the game for me are still all in this game.  I think there were elements of DAO that certain types of gamers really liked that were removed from DA2.  For me personally the world, the combat system, and feel of the game are consistent and remind me of what I liked about DAO.<br />- Nice graphics and cut scenes with a cinematic feel.<br />- Dialogue choices are interesting (emoticons and wheel selection don't in any way bother me as they do some reviewers).<br /><br />Weaknesses:<br />- There are fewer companions (than DA)).  Also, the first few you encounter are quite bland.  Still, this is only a weakness in that the companions aren't as good as DAO.  Judged on their own merit they are still quite engaging.<br />- Very linear level design.<br />- There are better \\"loot games\\" available.  Weapon selection is interesting but not amazing (OK, the mage staff with a blade is actually somewhat amazing) and you can't equip armor you find on your companions.<br /><br />Value:<br />At the $19.99 going price I'd say DA is a good solid 3 or 4 star game.  At $5 it is an amazing game that can't be missed.
