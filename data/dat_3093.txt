For some reason, I keep seeing poor reviews of this game.  It completely baffles me.  I've been playing since beta and I'm continually amazed at how much I love this game more and more.  Of course it has had its bumps during launch, but what MMO hasn't?  No, I'm not just some ESO fanboy, I genuinely love this game.  Everything from graphics, storyline, combat, crafting, exploration, role playing and PVP have been amazing.<br /><br />Warning:  Don't buy this game if you have a tendency to get addicted to games.  You'll have serious withdrawal symptoms the times you are unable to play. ;)
