Outside of the PS3 Trilogy, these trilogies for the 360 and PC do not contain all the DLC for ME 2.<br /><br />This is unfortunate, as Shadow Broker is vital for the ME2 experience, and as for ME3.. well most the DLC is terrible but it does affect the story. In short, this isn't the trilogy to buy unless you're on the PS3, and even then the PS3 won't give you the DLC for ME3 so it's not really a complete trilogy.<br /><br />The games are great, so if you just want that then for 10 dollars it's fine, but they'll bleed you on the DLC.
