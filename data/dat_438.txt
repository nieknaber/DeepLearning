Its a nice game but the whole cinematic effects of head shots and one shot kills take away the fun after a while.<br />A minor annoyance when you are immersed in shooting people in the heads anyway. :-)<br /><br />Overall, I would give it 4 stars just because I give 5 stars to products I absolutely love.
