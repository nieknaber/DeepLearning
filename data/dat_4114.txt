The game is beautiful.  But it's obviously designed for Xbox 360-style players, not PC gamers.  It feels very much like a console game.  Movement is via WASD keys, with camera angle controlled by the mouse. Characters lurch backward and forward, left and right like Mario Brothers or something.  Seems silly for a 2012 game, when I compare with other games with smooth character movement.<br /><br />I could live with that, maybe, except for the crashes and the launcher hangs.  Of 5 or 6 sessions playing, the game crashed about 5 times with an \\"8000:0000\\" error complaining about network problems.  Yet, other network games work just fine from my system.<br /><br />The worst was when I went to stop billing on the account.  Selecting the option to edit automatic renewal on the account offers up a dialog box with 'Accept' and 'Cancel' options.<br /><br />Neither selection changed the automatic billing.  I filed a ticket with support to tell them to cancel my account.  Maybe this game will be better in 2 or 3 years.
