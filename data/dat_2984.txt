There are a few things from the sims 2 seasons ep I would have liked to see return, but this ep is pretty amazing! I love the ability to customize the seasons and their lengths. I also love the realism of the seasons in this game and the effect on your sims. The holidays are a nice touch as well. Surprisingly, Snowflake Day is my favorite holiday in the game, which was unexpected for me being that in real life I'm a Halloween (Spooky Day) fanatic!<br /><br />I recommend this to anyone who wants to bring more dimension to their games and who enjoyed even remotely the seasons ep for The Sims 2.<br /><br />Happy simming!
