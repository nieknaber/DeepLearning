I bought my download code not even a week ago, and once I finally got registered on Origin after a few days of Origin not allowing me to register for absolutely no reason at all, I put in the download code and an error said that it was already used, even though I had just entered it for the first time.  This was going to be my first game download and it was downright disappointing.  I spoke to Amazon, who told me to e-mail EA who then told me to contact their support service, who basically told me to contact Amazon again.  I saw that someone else got reimbursed with a hard copy of the game, and so I'm asking if I can get the same thing?  I really want to play this game and am very disappointed that I can't play it instead of studying for finals.
