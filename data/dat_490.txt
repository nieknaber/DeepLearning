One sentence says it all: Fun game for the money. It has an original and interesting game concept. Might not play for more than a couple hours straight but taking a break (a few days) and then playing again is pretty fun. It plays smoothly and has really nice graphics. Overall, I would, if it were made, buy the sequel especially if they added more in-game shop customer interactions. If you like seek and find games but would like some sort of twist on it, this would be the game for you.
