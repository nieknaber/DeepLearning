So after buying this game I installed it on both of my computers, my Desktop and my Laptop. Then I had to switch out my graphics card thanks to a blown cap, and had to put in an older card lying around instead, until I bought a new one.  I get my new card, put it in, and then try to play this game. Apparently, I USED UP MY 3 ACTIVATIONS FOR THIS GAME EVEN THOUGH I ONLY USED IT ON TWO COMPUTERS.  This means that if I wanted to continue playing this game, I'd have to put in the old card I was using temporarily, that won't even run a lot of other games I play.  Thanks Ubisoft, You're idiotic policy, just lost you a customer because I will never be buying any of your products ever again! Hope it was worth it.
