Well, there is another pack called \\"Plethora of Paradox Games\\" which include this game + a few DLCs (but NOT the expansion DLCs) and a few other games for $20 (heard that it was once $10 only).  That's a better deal than downloading this game alone.<br /><br />Back to the game itself, it is a very addictive game.  I played around 150 hours thus far.  The game is to build a dynasty that rules (or survives) over time, including the Mongol invasions.  There are few scenarios to choose from, and of which the \\"William the Conquer\\" period is the most interesting to me.  It is great to start from a Count, invade (but you need to fab fake claims first, unless you want to start a Holy War!) nearby Counts to expand, and eventually build up a Kingdom (in my case Georgia)...  and once passing it down to the heir (there are many ways), the Kingdom starts to fall apart (well, not yet; it takes 3 generations to see it happens for me).<br /><br />There are still some glitches in the game, in particular that there is no load game option.  I can resign and load saved game, but by doing so it would lead to memory leak and eventually crash the game.  Sometimes I can also see the AI armies not knowing where to go and stay in a place to die (of disease) or not coming over to defend while being attacked.
