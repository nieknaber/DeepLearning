Pretty good games. I don't usually play video games, but I bought this one when it had a deal I couldn't pass up. I originally wanted the box, but now thinking baout it, I feel better without the box. I didn't want to kill trees. :)<br /><br />Good games. I liked Arkham City more than AA. I played them in order.
