I bought this along with the Psycho pack when Amazon was having a sale.  I love finding these type of deals as you really can't go wrong if you play the game a lot.  If you play Boarderlands 2 and love the game, you can't go wrong with this add on.  It offers a different play style from the normal characters while you still get that great Boarderlands feel.  While you're still playing the same game, the options this character offers definitely  mixes things up and gives you something new to look forward too.  It's a new character, it's Boarderlands 2, it's fun... I can't really say anymore.
