I decided to go ahead and purchase this out of pure laziness to be honest... I just didn't want to go out in the snow to get a video game when I figured I could just get it online. Worst mistake.<br /><br />It doesn't work. at all.<br /><br />I spent three days downloading it over and over again hoping and praying that maybe this time it would work, only to find the same error message. The game takes a couple hours to download (depending on your internet speed), another couple minutes to extract and do its thing, and another ten or so minutes to actually install. But once you go through all of that waiting, it just won't start because of an \\"unknown error\\". Five hours later all you get is an \\"unknown error\\". At one point I almost wished it just wouldn't download so that I wouldn't have to keep waiting for it to work.<br /><br />I tried it at least six different times. I googled and googled till I had gone through everything. I used all of my html and computer skills, as well as my friends'. I took it to the apple store to make sure my Macbook Pro wasn't the problem. I called EA only be hung up on and then was told to call Amazon. So I called amazon and finally, I got a refund for this ridiculous product and now I'm so happy to be done with this entire debacle.<br /><br />So seriously, don't buy it. It just won't work.<br /><br />Also, a huge thank you to the amazing customer service reps at Amazon. They were amazing and super helpful and handled my freak outs really well. (:
