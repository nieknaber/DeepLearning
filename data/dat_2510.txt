If you haven't played the castlevania series then this is a fun one to start with; unlike some of the earliest ones it is very non-linear and there is lots of exploring to do. If you are familiar with the series then this is a fairly faithful port of the original US version (hence only 5 familiars and no extras like on the saturn version). As far as I can tell, most everything is the same, even the glitches (like the sword brothers money glitch). Have had a couple of issues with it freezing when I try to access my inventory, but only rarely and at the very end (when I was over 190%); just be sure to save often!    As far as the purchase process goes it is very straightforward. Just find the game on Xbox Live, go to Redeem Code and then enter the code you get from Amazon. It gets downloaded to your hardrive so that anyone using the xbox can play it. It is also tied to your username, so if you get a new xbox you can re-download it, although in this case it will only be available when signed in as the original user.
