This got panned in reviews (and rightly so) when it was first released due to Obsidian's unfortunate habit of releasing games in a buggy mess. That being said, their writing and ability to tell a story is top notch, and this game is no exception.<br /><br />Multiple endings, multiple ways to approach each story, and the actual feeling of being a secret agent a la Jason Bourne or Jack Ryan is present in gameplay.<br /><br />I decided to give this game a chance recently, and with most of the bugs fixed and game balanced, now is a good time to enjoy what is really an excellent game. I definitely recommend it, and hope that Obsidian one day releases something that isn't a broken mess because their ability to craft an experience is second to none.
