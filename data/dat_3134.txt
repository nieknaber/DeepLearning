Years ago my son and I enjoyed playing an earlier version of Roller Coaster Tycoon. So I got this as a family Christmas gift. We again enjoyed making parks, adding rides, and this time we can even place fireworks displays! The only down side is that in some of the parks you have to please VIPs who have random expectations. I've found building to please someone else less than satisfying. However, that requirement is only in a few of the parks offered. Anyway, that aside, I've enjoyed becoming a tycoon again.
