Over the top.<br />If you are looking for amazing graphics, and real world game play, go to GTAV. (Sadly, not for the PC.)<br /><br />But if you are looking for crazy, sexy, and retarded fun, this is the game for you!<br />The intro mission makes the game awesome, and the story line is funny as hell. Well worth the purchase just to have a game you can wreck havoc in!
