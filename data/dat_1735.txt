I really enjoyed this game and the sequel, \\"Avenue Flo, Special Delivery\\"!  They are adventure games, not time management so don't get confused on that.  I would have given this one five stars IF they had a \\"skip\\" option on the minigames.  I had to have my husband get me through the aerobics board.  I just could not go fast enough and I read on the BigFish forum that many other people got stuck on that board and had to quit.  On \\"Special Delivery\\" you can skip so that is great.  Flo is such a fun and industrious girl.  Going on an adventure with her to help Quinn plan a wedding for Miss Big was a delight.  I see this is no longer available here so go to BigFish and download it instead!  Loved it!
