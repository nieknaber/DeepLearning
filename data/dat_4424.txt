I enjoyed this addition of the diner dash series. My only complaint is that it was way to easy to achieve an expert score. It was not challenging but I love the fact that it is family friendly. Very similar to Hotel Dash 1 with some minor twists that makes it interesting. Great addition to my game collection.
