I've played 1, 2, and 3. None of the in between 2 and 3. I only liked 2. I hated 1 and 3. I bought this to do a digital upgrade on the PS4 when this was on sale on Black Friday and I was definitely surprised at how much I enjoyed this game. I could not get into 3 at all and this game is a major improvement.<br /><br />The main character is actually likable. More so than even Ezio in my opinion and miles ahead of whatever his name was in 3. The environments work great for the free running aspects of the game and best of all is the atmosphere. It is great to sail the seas as your crew sings shanties. It's great that the series is now 1080p on consoles. I played 2 on the PC and 3 on the PS3 so I already sort of knew what to expect.<br /><br />I'm happy that the present timeline happenings is kept to a minimum because those parts just bring the game to a standstill with incredibly uninteresting conversations and characters. That's how it was in pretty much every Assassins Creed game I've played. At least they're short and rare occurring.<br /><br />I as well have Battlefield 4, Killzone Shadow Fall, and Knack; as well as the PS+ games, and this is by far the most enjoyable game of the bunch for me. It never crashes. It's just pure solid.
