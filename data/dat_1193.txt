ok, so the game is a typical simcity, more road options, more interaction with the sims etc...  In fact, I like playing it a LOT.  The only problem is that if I want to play this multi player game with anyone else in my house I have to buy a second copy for them to play at the same time as me.  This is a HUGE problem because we LOVE playing multiplayer simulation games together, but take this game and times it by 3, and it gets mighty expensive for what you get for it.<br />Unlike other games like Civilization and Colonization, which don't charge for extra players and give you the option to play multiplayer with more than one computer in the house, this game limits me to playing with strangers only.  Also, to waiting for my turn on the game, which sucks.
