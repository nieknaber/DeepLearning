The game is basically impossible for me to play. It does that &#34;realistic&#34; walk so you bobble back and forth. That motion gives me motion sickness. I didn't see a way to disable it.<br /><br />I couldn't play it for long but at times it got really slow. Like the hardware wasn't good enough to maintain frame rate.
