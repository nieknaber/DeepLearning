I am an avid fan of Obsidian and consider Alpha Protocol and Fallout: NV to be masterpieces.<br /><br />DS3 is extremely competent. The combat is fun enough and it has an unprecedented amount of polish for an Obsidian game but ultimately it just lacks the soul of the other Obsidian games that have made me a fanboy.
