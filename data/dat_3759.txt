I now have played all three Mass Effect (ME) games. The Mass Effect universe and characters are great entertainment and I have played the prior games multiple times and had fun each time.<br /><br />After all my devotion, as I neared the end of ME3 I was confident that justice, victory and glory were soon to be at hand for me and my team. As I played further to the end I found that I was misguided in my expectations. The ending did not fit the game and was not a correct reward for the over 100 hours I have devoted to crafting my character and cultivating relationships.<br /><br />In ME3, the outcome seems to come from some oblique line of reasoning that runs counter to all that has gone before. It was as if a Deus Ex Machina was being inserted to maliciously wreck the story instead of to save it. And wreck it, it does. It wrecks it to pieces.<br /><br />I did enjoy the game play and the time spent immersed in this very special gaming universe. If it were not for the final 10 minutes I'd give it 5 stars.<br /><br />However, the ending is an insult. The conclusion, we were promised, would honor our previous choices and relationships. That did not happen. As such, the game (as a product) is defective. It does not meet the expectations the developers promoted to the public. This is why I rate it as three stars only. The game does not match the product description. I would return it if I could on these grounds.
