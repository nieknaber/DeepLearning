Born from a sullied and worthless lineage: the completely forgettable True Crime series, Sleeping dogs is yet another Sandbox GTA clone. But with clever writing, a memorable locale of Hong Kong, vibrant and terrifying characters and a soundtrack that may be the best in the GTA style games since the very first 3d GTA... Sleeping Dogs is greater than the sum of all it's parts.<br /><br />Be wary of the DLC, but most of the mission packs are worth it, especially the brief but awesome 'Zodiac Island'.<br /><br />While it is a little buggy, lacks the depth of some of the other sandbox games (when it's over, it's over), I still give it my Highest Possible Recommendation
