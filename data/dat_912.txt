This is your best option if you need an Xbox Live code right away, whether it be at 2AM or in the middle of rush hour. Most sites I've gone through send their codes through email which can take hours or even days at times. By purchasing through Amazon your code is displayed at the end of checkout for you to use or email. The convenience of not having to go to the store or wait for an email delivery is well worth the 5 stars alone. This will be my main source for renewing my membership or buying ms points from now on.
