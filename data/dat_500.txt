Sure, the graphics on Crysis Warhead were ASTONISHINGLY good on hi-end systems, no doubt about it.  But the rap on the Crysis games were that they were resource hogs -- totally true. You could just take a walk in a tropical jungle, in a light drizzle, and just enjoy the sights and sounds.  Cry2 is in NYC, where this just isn't possible, and I'm sure an attempt was made to allow lower-end systems to play the game at a higher level.  For me, Cry2 is the best one, story-wise, SP player-wise, and overall enjoyment-wise.  Make no mistake, I loved ALL of them....
