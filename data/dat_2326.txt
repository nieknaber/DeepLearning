I enjoy puzzle games that are fun, but make me think.  Mumbo Jumbo games are always entertaining and well done, but some of their games are more challenging than others.  The graphics here are well done as always -- the cursor is a bony skeleton hand -- but the puzzles on this particular game are not as challenging as they could be (the reason for only 4 stars).  The hidden objects are often tricky to find, but the puzzles are too easy to figure out.  It ikeeps your attention and there are actually three games (murder mysteries) to go through.  I'm playing it for the third time, so it is enjoyable and I plan to get another in the Midnight Mysteries series.  If you want a game that is well done, entertaining and will last for more than just a few hours, consider this one.
