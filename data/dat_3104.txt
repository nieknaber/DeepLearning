I've just finished my free trial period which is a whole month, depending how you play you can reach max level on atleast one job in that time frame and get a good feel of the game for yourself and as i said in the title it's very casual friendly, don't need to give away 10 hours a day of your life to this game (yet).<br /><br />it's gameplay is very fun and the game itself has some aspects of it that can grab onto nostalgia if you're a Final Fantasy veteran for example Materia can be placed on equipment to gain benefits, you can see Magitek armor around the game and even get one as a mount. Those 2 examples are from Final Fantasy VII and VI for those of you who have not played the FF games before there are plenty of other references to older FF games along with references to entirely different games such as a Metal Gear Solid reference during one of the story missions. As for the classes/jobs each class/job feels unique in it's own ways once you get above level 10, just got my Monk to level 50(Max current level cap). There are multiple types of jobs to choose from. I'll give a small description of each from what i understand about them so far.<br /><br />Disciples of War:<br />•Gladiator (later on turns into  Paladin) which is a tank class who's role is to direct the enemies attention to him/herself to protect the party make things run smoothly.<br />•Pugilist (later turns into Monk) which is a DPS/DD class (Damage Per Second/Damage Dealer) it's role is to pretty much pummel the enemy down with brute force and combo type moves.<br />•Marauder (later turns into Warrior) which is another tank like class just like paladin it's role is to keep the enemies on him but i believe it's a more DPS/DD oriented job, (I've not personally played it so i could be mistaken.)<br />•Lancer (later turns into Dragoon) is also a DPS/DD class that gains a lot depending on what order they use their abilities in, some abilities will gain a bonus if uses after another or from different positions around the enemy.<br />•Archer (Later turns into bard) this is a ranged DPS/DD/Support class as Archer it's pretty much a DPS/DD but once you unlock Bard it turns into more of a DPS and Support class, it can cast beneficial effects to help the party defeat enemies and also gains benefits from being in certain positions and staying away from the enemy. (I've not personally played it so i could be mistaken.)<br /><br />Disciples of Magic:<br />•Conjurer (later turns into White Mage) which is a healing mage job, it uses it's magic to keep the party and/or him/herself alive, and is able to revive fallen players. It does also have the ability to do some DPS/DD with certain spells, but, i believe that's only really useful if your going to be soloing.<br />•Thaumaturge (later turns into Black Mage) which is a DPS/DD mage job, simply put it's role is to fight from a distance and overwhelm it's targets with hard hitting spells before they have a chance to retaliate, what they lack in defense they make up in power.<br />•Arcanist (later turns into Summoner and/or Scholar) this one I'll be totally honest and say i don't know much about, it depends which way you wanna take it, Summoner i believe is primarily DPS/DD oriented where as Scholar.. again i -believe- is a healer type class. Arcanist itself can do both roles decently DPS/DD or healer i'm fairly certain. I've not tried it so i can't say.<br /><br />That's all of the classes/jobs listed above hopefully it helps you make a decision when/if you pick the game up.<br /><br />The leveling system is very interesting, it's based around questing when you start and turns more towards Fates, Levequests and Dungeons later on.<br />•Quests if you're unsure and have never played games like this are objectives given to you by NPCs (non-playable characters) where you need to fetch items for them, dispatch enemies or even do something very simple, like, walk around town and talk to people or find something theymay have lost. When whatever the objective was is completed you recieve your reward and possibly open up more quest lines/story options. Most quests have a pretty decently written little story attached to them so that's a bonus along with the experience points and Gil (gold) rewards.<br /><br />•Fates are battles with different objectives that can pop up in most any area excluding in the main cities and have a timer of about 13min, actual duration depends on number of players around and doing fates. They are great ways to gain experience points and alittle Gil (Gold) throughout your adventures. The objectives can sometimes be to dispatch all of the enemies that show up, could be a few or it could be a whole lot of them. Possibly one large Notorious Monster, only one enemy to defeat but it usually has a lot of Hit Points and requires more then 1 person to be able to finish. Or even something like pickup up items laying around the ground or retrieving items from enemies around the area and giving them to a specific NPC near the Fate.<br /><br />•Levequests like the name says.. atleast i think so.. they are quests to help you level. Depending on your level, what zone your in, and what job you are they can be easy or hard. Levequests give options of usually 4 different quests per zone/per level tier you gain access to new tiers every 5 levels starting at level 10 i believe. Objectives range from escorting an NPC to safety, to pacifying (not killing) enemies around the area. You get the option to raise the difficulty up to a max of +4, in other words if your level 22 and your in a level 20 area you have the option to raise the quest level up to 24 for more challenge. With more challenge comes more rewards, you gain more experience points and gil if you complete it on higher difficulty, you also gain a bonus for speed if you can complete the objectives quickly. Levequests are also not just for classes experience, you can use them to level crafting stuff which ill talkabout later down the review.<br /><br />•Dungeons at early levels are taken on by a party of 4 players 2 DPS/DDs, 1 Tank, 1 Healer at around level 50 you start getting dungeons that require 8 people, 4 DPS 2 Tanks 2 Healers, or 24 people which is just the 8 person party but 3 of them. Along with experience points gained from dungeons you can also obtain equipment for your classes that cannot be obtained by other means and is usually better then what you can get from a crafter or quests around that level. Each dungeon has different objectives and mechanics but all of them stay true to a single format until you get up to level 50 anyway, 2 mini bosses and 1 main boss. The bosses are spaced out so you have a few minutes of fighting and getting to the 1st, fight it, then you have some more adventuring to do before the 2nd boss, etc. As i said the dungeons themselves have varying mechanics as do the bosses, some bosses might just be stand there and wail on it where as others if you were to do that you'd lose the fight in a matter of seconds. It's not hard to learn what each does after your first attempt.<br /><br />That's my description of most of the ways to level in this game as of right now, that could change in the future, but, there is no way to tell.<br /><br />Crafting in this game definitely caught my eye, coming from Final Fantasy XI crafting was kind of bland and boring where as here it's very indepth. Crafting works almost exactly like leveling a Disciple of War or Magic in the way that you gain experience points rather than 0.1, 0.2, etc up to 1.0 to gain a point. As i said above levequests have the option to do crafting jobs as well as your melee or mage jobs, the difference is for the crafting ones you just need to turn in something you are able to craft for experience and gil, if you trade a HQ (high quality) item you can double the reward given. The downside of this is you can see lazy people just buy the items needed from a vendor and trade that, i personally like crafting it myself for the HQ chance and double reward. along with levequests for experience and just plain crafting, you gain a bonus for each item you craft that you've not crafted before, the game itself keeps a &#34;Crafting Log&#34; so you don't have to search around online to find the recipes like you had to do in Final Fantasy XI. You have a lot of control over what your making, it feels more rewarding to level a craft on this game in my opinion and depending on what other crafts you have leveled you can gain benefits towards certain things like Quality or Control over what your doing. Along with crafting there are Gathering jobs so you don't have to rely on other players or merchants as much for materials. I'll give some descriptions of them below. (Most of the crafts are self-explanatory just by looking at the names)<br /><br />Disciples of Hand:<br />•Carpenter is the crafting class that work with wood, it can make logs into lumber, equipment such as polearms (spears), bows and shields, and some armors. Since Free Company housing was added i would assume they can do furniture too.<br />•Blacksmith is a crafting class that works with metals bronze, steel, etc. They can make ingots, rivets, chains, tools, and weapons.<br />•Armorer is the crafting class as the name says that can make armor, usually heavy armor for jobs like Gladiator and Marauder. It benefits from having blacksmith leveled because it can use some of the materials blacksmiths make for it's armor.<br />•Goldsmith is another crafting class that works with metals but also does jewels and specializes in rings, necklaces, bracelets. It can make weapons but usually for mage type jobs or tools for other crafting classes.<br />•Leatherwork is a crafting class that specializes in obviously leather but leather is used to make light and mid-range armors for jobs such as Lancer, Pugilist and Archer, it also makes alot of equipment for the other crafting classes.<br />•Weaver isa crafting class that works with cloth, it can make light equipment for jobs like Leatherworker but usually only does the really light armors and equipment for other crafting classes as well.<br />•Alchemist is the crafting class that works with potions and status enhancing stuff of the like, it also can make stuff that can benefit all of the other crafts.<br />•Culinarian is the crafting class that makes the food in the game, and if your wondering why do you need food in a video game that isn't the Sims, food can give large boosts to stats like Strength, Vitality, Critical Hits, and almost all of it gives a +3% bonus to experience gained.<br /><br />Now we move onto the gathering jobs which i mentioned above, they are meant to get materials for the crafting classed but you don't need to level a crafting class to level gathering, you have the option to sell your materials you gather on the Market Boards for a profit.<br /><br />Disciples of Land:<br />•Miner is the gathering class that looks for stuff like ores and gems, it benefits goldsmith, blacksmith, and armorer to have this gatherer leveled.<br />•Botanist is the gathering class that looks for stuff like grasses that can be turned into thread, cotton to be turned into thread and clothes, and flowers/plants that can be used by alchemists for potions.<br /><br />That's my Review over all, i hope it helped out, first time doing a written review on anything so i tried to make it as in depth as i could to give people some insight on the game and some of it's mechanics. Also I'm sorry about my grammar and punctuation I've never been very good at either.<br /><br />If it did help you and you decide to pick up the game come over to Sargantas and say hi, player name is Stryger Severino.<br /><br />  Thanks for Reading.
