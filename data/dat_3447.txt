I was a little upset about how they had rushed the making of this game since it was so anticipated after DAO.<br />The graphics are wonderful and the combat style was better...however I feel that the story line suffered greatly.<br />I had played this game at a friends house previously after going through DAO and DAOA and was not impressed by it but I bought it because it was a great price at the time and I wanted to give it another chance. I have played through all of it and it was just okay to me. I expected more. I have high hopes for DAI though! ...it's okay to dream! T ^ T
