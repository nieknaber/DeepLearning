While I would have loved to elaborate on this game further, the awkward and often debilitating camera angles rendered this game nearly unplayable. I found myself giving up on it about 45 minutes in. I could never seem to get a look forward when I needed, and instead looked in the wrong direction enough that the game was nearly impossible. A few days later, I got the game for PS3 and no such issues. I'll be playing it on that platform. The port for this game is the culprit, not the game itself.
