I purchased this game from Ubisoft right after its release. Had trouble with the install. Got moderately good assistance from support. I never was able to get the game to launch and, after going around with support several times, I was told it was my hardware and I need upgrades. (It was a brand new gaming machine with state of the art, top of the line components and far exceeded the minimum requirements listed on the site which I read with great care before the purchase.)<br /><br />The final blow was when the newly released installation upgrade kept crashing my machine. I uninstalled the game and asked for a refund (which I never got). I later discovered while running a routine malware scan that the installation file for ANNO 2070 contained a malicious trojan virus. I sent Ubisoft a copy of the report. Never got a reply. That speaks volumes to me about this company. It took me several months of work to get my machine clean and running smoothly once again.<br /><br />This was not by any means my first Ubisoft purchase but this experience means it will be my last. I thought perhaps my experience might have been an isolated one. After reading all the reviews here, I see I am not alone. So that should be enough to tell anyone considering buying this game...DON'T! Save your money and protect the bigger investment (your expensive gaming computer). Not worth the trouble and headaches.
