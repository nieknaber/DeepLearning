After waiting a week for the tech support people to get back to me, I found out why the game keeps crashing on character creation. The Intel HD 4000 Graphics card that comes with a Macbook Pro DOES NOT WORK FOR THIS GAME, EVEN THOUGH according to the Elder Scrolls Online website, it passes the minimum requirements.<br /><br />I spoke to someone at the company and it is THEIR BAD for listing a card that does not work. They better take the damned game back since it's 100% their fault.
