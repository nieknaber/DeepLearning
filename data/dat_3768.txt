I've been playing SimCity in one way, shape, or form since I was a kid. It is HUGELY disappointing to see this game title treated in such a way. I've played this game a total of MAYBE 1 hour since I purchased it, because it's impossible to log in to Origin's backwards systems to actually PLAY THE GAME I PAID MONEY FOR.<br /><br />This is a failure. Plain and simple. Save your money. I wish I still had mine.<br /><br />EDIT: Now that I've actually been able to play the game, I can say this. This is a BAD game. The fundamental structure of it, the AI, is broken. That's your reason right there. Also, the constant online state forces you to name your cities a certain way. It forces you to play the game in very preset formats dictated by the designers. This isn't a sandbox anymore. It's a funhouse without the fun. Running from point to point being force fed content and now, recently, being advertised to in game. There is NOTHING left of what was once a great game. All that remains is a husk. A shill meant to be a constant drain from your wallet under the guise of \\"content\\" (a Nissan ad, actually).<br /><br />I wouldn't stop at suggesting you save your money on this game. I would IMPLORE you NOT to buy it, so that if fails. So that this blot on the gaming community is bleached and all the EA Games that come after will know that a certain amount of respect should be showed to their customer base.
