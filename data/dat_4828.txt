Cannot beat level 4 of game 1---keep drowning.  Annoying as all get out.  Mastered many Sega games; this one appears to be beyond me, yet it isn't the most difficult Sega game I've played.  Have searched for &#34;cheats&#34; for helpful pointers, but cannot find any.  If games can be rented, you may want to rent, first, instead of wasting your money.  Good luck.
