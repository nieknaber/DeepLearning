Runner, Core and Beat are excellent games on their own, regrettably, Void isn't.<br /><br />All of the games are rhythm based, or have heavy emphasis on the beats in the Background Music. Very colorful, and easy on the graphics, pretty much any computer can run them.<br /><br />Couple of complaints though, the difficulty spike in all of the games is extreme. The first few levels/stages (in any of the games) are easy because they're teaching you the controls, but you're barely out of the tutorial when the game ramps up the difficulty and REALLY makes you sweat. This wouldn't be an issue if it depended on how skillful you are, but it doesn't, it's more of a &#34;how good can you remember this stage&#34; gameplay, as in, Trial-and-error (Runner being the exception).<br /><br />Another thing is that sometimes the beats can be confused with the colorful backgrounds, which adds to the already present difficulty of the game, not exactly something to look forward to.<br /><br />I HIGHLY suggest you use a controller for Core and Runner, KB+M works fine for the other two.<br /><br />As I mentioned early, Void isn't great, in fact, it's pretty much bland. Coming from Runner's colorful environments and Beat's fast paced gameplay, and different kind of &#34;beats&#34;, when you play Void, you really are left with a void, pun very much intended.<br /><br />It's slow, ugly, the music is really not in the style of the other games, and VERY simple (not to imply it isn't affected by the difficulty spike, the mechanics are even simpler than in the other games)<br /><br />If you're buying this bundle, I can guarantee you'll like at least 3 games out of 4.
