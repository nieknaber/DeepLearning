I am having problem after problem loading this game onto my computer. The customer service help is horrible. Slow and certainly not helpful. as a matter of fact, I'd like a refund unless I can get this game working for my daughter. Ridiculous how long its been since I downloaded it and still have yet to play the game. I will NOT purchase another game through Amazon again. Never Never Never. :(
