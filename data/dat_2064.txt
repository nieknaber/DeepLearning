There are a lot of cool features added in this expansion pack like resorts, boats, sea side houses, etc. And the community that comes with it would be a great place to experience all of it, however there are some major limitations. The lag and bugs are so bad, it is nearly unplayable. And before jumping to the conclusion that its all my computer, I've had no issues running other games like Battlefield 3 at high. No wonder EA was voted worst company for the second year in a row when they are releasing games that are unfinished and untested. I seriously question the people who run EA and think they all deserve a trip to prison for knowingly selling a subpar product then doing nothing to fix the issues.
