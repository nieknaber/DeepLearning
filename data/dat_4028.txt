And 0 support from it's makers.<br />The game has memory leaks and needs a patch, but will never get one for PC.<br />Even on high end rigs, the game will slow down and become so framey(choppy)it becomes almost unplayable. And forget playing with a friend because it gets worse.<br /><br />Tim and Double Fine should be ashamed at this shoddy, non-supported console port to PC.
