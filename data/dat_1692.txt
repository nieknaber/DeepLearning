Having played a bit of this games predecessor, X-Blades, I assumed i knew what to expect. I was definitely wrong. The controls were tight and the combat entertaining. The story could have been a little better but it served its purpose. The time manipulation ability was used exceptionally well in this game as fighting a boss while time clones replay your earlier attacks was very fun!
