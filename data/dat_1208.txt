NBA 2K12 is a flawless game, on the court. There are several modes, including the popular My Player, that have more depth than the NBA itself. Doesn't matter which mode you choose; you're gonna play out the current NBA season on that one mode alone. And you would've had a blast each and every time you load up a game---then 2K Sports steps in to louse it all up.<br /><br />First off, don't reply to this talking about \\"they have great Mods for PC games if you know the correct site.\\" Well, I knew 3-4 correct sites. What those sites told me was that it took 6 months before a patch was released to repair the dozens of developmental flaws. Yes, the version I played that was so buggy it ruined a revolutionary game was actually the PATCHED version. A typical game goes like this: you score 3 consecutive baskets, get a couple rebounds, maybe a block...then the game freezes up. It's not just me, these \\"great mod forums\\" mention these in great detail. So, upon reloading, you don't wait for those baskets, the rebound and block; you get one or two then save mid-game to make sure you retain these, then reload. Make sure you have your 3rd party gaming boosters handy, because every reload slows court action considerably. But if you get a steal and score a dunk on a breakaway, it's save and reload time again. Rinse and repeat until you spend 90 minutes for a 30 minute affair. It's not my system. Again, the forums on the recommended sites have the same, if not more problems that I have had.<br /><br />Now for the bad part. Oh yeah, there's a cherry on top! 2KSports Online works great...except for the whole online part. I'm not talking about playing friends and strangers online, I'm talking about the 2KShare, where in the past you were able to download rosters, game sliders, rookie drafts, everything you need to hit the ground running. Not ONCE have I successfully gotten past the server. Not only does it say it will not be working, it tells you to check YOUR connection. Go to any forumto find a workaround with the forum search feature will greet you with a dozen threads dedicated to how 2KShare is never online and how they also haven't gotten in.<br /><br />Perhaps worst of all, the only reason I dropped the 40 bucks was because 2KSports eradicated EVERYTHING for NBA 2K11. Even if you were lucky enough to find downloads 2KSports saw to it they wouldn't work. After all, a new game was out even though I was more than content with 2K11. I couldn't have ever imagined it would've gotten worse by tenfold with the new game.<br /><br />NBA 2K12 is great. No, it's better than great. But with the developer's seemingly purposeful mishandling of its product it makes the game's excellence moot. Actually it makes it more aggravating; the game is so great that you will spend the time trying to finish it. And you'll try, and try, then try harder until you realize one fact: a bad game with great customer service is 80x better than a great game with seemingly intentionally wretched customer service. Shame on you, 2K Sports. Pass on this.
