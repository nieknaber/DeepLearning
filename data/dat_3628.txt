And is fun, its much better than GuitarHero in the sense that you aren't mashing buttons, you are playing. I only play the bass module, not interested in guitar. Most PC guitar/bass trainers are heavy on guitar and weak on bass. This game covers them both really nicely. I bought 2013 and loved it, so it was a no brainer to get the 2014 edition.
