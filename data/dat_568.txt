I highly recommend this game to anyone who likes both history and strategy games.  There is a lot of settlement management, especially as your empire grows, but there are plenty of battles to engage in too and are fun to fight.  Barbarian invasion adds an additional challenge since new factions keep popping up and displaced armies are always roving around in groups.  This keeps you fighting on more than just one front. It's really interesting to experiment with different configurations of armies too, I have found that large groups of light cavalry are both cheap, effective, and a great way to win heroic victories since the AI isn't always very reactive to your movements.  I love this game though and am looking forward to trying the Alexander expansion.
