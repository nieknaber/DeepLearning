For the seven bucks that I paid for this game, it was a real bargain. Kind of tricky to get the hang of lanes but with a few trial runs, that becomes a thing of the past. I recommend this game to add to your computer. Amazon makes it all the better where I can download it and not have to wait (or pay) for shipping and delivery.
