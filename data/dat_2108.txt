I always wanted 2k13, but i dont have a ps3 or xbox to play one. So i just bought this pc version, which is quite satisfying. I have to warn you, that it doesnt have all the features of the ps3 or xbox version, like the fact that it doesnt have vc currency. The graphics are great, if you have a good processor (mine was the minimum requirement and it still plays fine). It may lag a bit, but that's only if you play for 5 hours. If you had the choice to buy another version, then just forget it. But if you don't have a ps3 or xbox, this is a nice alternative.
