The product was a downloaded version of Build-a-lot.  Unfortunately the software would not run as downloaded.  Not a single feature of the game could be viewed due to the failure of the program.  We did contact customer support for assistance and were given a series of instructions to overcome the problem.  After working through these instructions twice, we were still left with an computer program that would not run.  Following this failure, company took our contact information and promised to call with further options.  More than a month later, we are still waiting.<br /><br />We will not buy from this company again.
