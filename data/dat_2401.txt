Everything EA touches turns to s***. They ruined Mass Effect. They ruined Tiger Woods. Now they have ruined Sim City. Thanks EA, you are the all powerful franchise destroyer. No one is more powerful than you when it comes to destroying games and customers hopes. Maybe when you release your next game it can be just an empty box.
