I ended up in the awkward situation where i bought this game many moons ago then this thing called origin came about. - And Then through registration problems i lost my keys for that copy of the game. ANYWHO, i bought this, the download arrived, it downloaded, it patched, its playable and i was able to properly register the keys with my origin account.<br /><br />-&#62;in terms of the game its still fun to play, lots of hardcore pc players epically since bf3 was overrun with cod kiddies.
