One of the best games I have seen. This franchise pack is epic. The game is super fun to play and the graphics are good. Don't let IGN fool you this is a great game. The story line follows &#34;Death&#34; as your character and picks up right where the last one left off. It takes you this other world with &#34;The makers&#34; and really takes off from there. Characters have great personality and the game is easy to pick up. I did the download and while it takes a while to download, it came in clean and installed properly. I have zero complaints about the download or the game. Oh and if you play with a keyboard and mouse its &#34;v&#34; to throw something if you dont have a 3rd mouse button. Took forever to figure that out.
