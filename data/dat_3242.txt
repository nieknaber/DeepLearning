This game, when it first came out might have been AWESOME.  It has atmosphere, it's so weird and I love that so much; on the other hand, the graphics are so outdated!  It's painful to play if you're adjusted towards modern games.  I played maybe two hours before I couldn't take it.  It feels incomplete and glitchy compared with the more finished products on the market today.  It would be worth a look-see if you can stand lengthy (I mean lengthy!) dialogues without voice acting for the sake of the true magic the game has to offer, but... save your money until the price comes down to say $5 or less.  Then you won't kick yourself.
