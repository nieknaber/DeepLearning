I would have rated it 5 stars but the version sold on Amazon lacks the \\"cheat\\" option that allows the player to increase (or decrease) any of the avatar characteristics and change the age for longer play.      There are multiple endings, multiple craft recipes, multiple cooking recipes - all sorts of places to explore and people to interact with.      I've had this game for a couple years and have still not achieved all the endings even WITH the cheat options.
