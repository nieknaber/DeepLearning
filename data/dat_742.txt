This game is entertaining for a bit but it doesnt hold my attention for long. I like sim games, tycoon, building games, etc. but this one left me feeling a little dssappointed. That's not to say that it's not well done, the game looks pretty good and it's fun to watch some of the movies play out. Maybe I just need to stick with it and play it more. I've recently played Roller Coaster Tycoon 3 and found that to be a very addicting, very satisfying experience. I wish The Movies was more like that.
