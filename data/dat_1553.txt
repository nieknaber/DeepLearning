I have been a fan of Civilization since I or II.  I am totally disgusted with Civilization V.  The load up sequence where you get to see the Elder [old Fart] welcome his son is OK the first time you watch it.  But you have to watch it every time you play the game!  Boring! No work around.  As others have said when it comes to speed this game is a snail.  And then there is the Steam Interface, totally unacceptable.  I am sorry I bought it!
