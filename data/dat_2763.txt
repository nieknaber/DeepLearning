If you're a Sims 3 fan, then you will like this.  You are able to control the weather - how much snow  you want on the ground, how long you want winter to be, spring to be, etc.  It adds additional game play such as festivals for each season for the whole family to enjoy.  This is a take it or leave it addition, but if you have the extra money it's worth buying.  Wait for the sales and you can get it for $9 or $7.
