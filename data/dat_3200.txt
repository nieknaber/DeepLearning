I have played Civ 3 and Civ Revolution. I remember really liking Civ 3 and Civ Revolution for PS3 is great! It's fast, quick, and exciting. This game, on the other hand, is like watching paint dry. Try it out for yourself, I guess. You do get 4 games. I really pushed myself to play but I couldn't get through the first few turns.
