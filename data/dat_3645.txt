Pricing is way off on these cards. Hydra jet is $50 real money based off this pricing and super cars are roughly $15-20. At that cost this $100 won't buy u ish in the game. Save your money or wait until pricing is adjusted. I wouldn't buy any of these. It's too easy to make money online to pay these outrageous prices.
