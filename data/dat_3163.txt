I loved this game, looking forward to a sequel.  It is very challenging.  The only thing I didn't like about it is if you got stuck on a room you couldn't go to the next room until you finished and the door open to continue.  They need a \\"hint\\" button or something so you can at least get an idea of where to go next.  Also if you don't finish the house you're working on and exit out when you go back in you have to start all over with the first room.  It should save your progress when you exit.  Other than that it was a fun, addicting game.  Would like to have others like it.
