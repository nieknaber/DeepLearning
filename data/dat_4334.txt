I've really enjoyed playing this adventure game. Puzzles require some thought but are not tedious or overdone. Gameplay is long, and story has humor without being obnoxious. Most voice acting is pretty good. Fun environment to be immersed in for a while. Cute story with ghosts, gypsies, skulls, pirates, Victorian street urchins. Perfect.
