Trine was pretty good for its time, but the sequel is much improved over it. Trine 2's graphics are better, general mechanics are better, everything is better.<br /><br />Since the story of these platformers are secondary, you're not gaining anything by playing Trine 1. Just go straight to Trine 2 and have fun.
