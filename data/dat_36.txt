If I had friends to play with, it could be fun. There's too many small things wrong with this game to really enjoy and WANT to play throughout it. Honestly, buy boderlands 2 if you're looking for a first person game to play that you can level up and customize your playstyle....if you're looking for a zombie multi-player, then play L4D2, if you're looking for just zombies and a story. Play The Walking Dead game and enjoy a story that you make a few game altering decisions in. But Dead Island will not make you happy for any money or time spent on it.<br /><br />The community on the game is pretty awful as well, I met maybe 1 other person who spoke English, and only 1 other person who spoke at all.
