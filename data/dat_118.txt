I was able to activate the game on steam without any issue. I bought Arkham Asylum first and this later. Both of the two games excel in their respective quarters. Arkham Asylum is better than Arkham City in terms of storyline and character development, while Arkham City is more engaging with the even improved flow of motion, controls, and a much expanded repertoire of actions you are able to perform as Batman; well, plus Catwoman.<br /><br />Worth every penny I paid.
