I'm a sucker for anything related to Saucy Jack, and I definitely feel like a huge sucker for buying Jack the Ripper: Letters From Hell.  There is very little to this game, and what there is isn't much fun at all.  I got through the whole game in forty-five minutes or so, and I'm sure that many players could finish much more quickly than I did.  I probably spent half my time trying to assemble a stupid camera based on the shadow it cast, which sometimes involved attaching pieces in mid-air.  Don't expect any insight into the crimes here - my visits to Whitechapel had me searching for rats, sheep, and inscriptions.  In the game, you \\"play\\" a dishonest reporter looking to drum up the circulation of his newspaper by sending in fake letters from the Whitechapel murderer.  As luck would have it, your visits to Whitechapel keep coinciding with the murders, and that puts you high on Inspector Abberline's list of suspects.  The only way to avoid suspicion is to perform stupid and irrelevant puzzles and answer a few memory-related questions (either I guessed correctly each time - which is highly unlikely - or it doesn't even matter if you get these right).  There's no animation, no voice acting, and no fun to be had with this game.
