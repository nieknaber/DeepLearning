For starters the PlayStation Plus service is great, just got Uncharted 3, DMC and Bioshock Infinite (3 games I was planing on buying) just for 50 bucks a year, I mean for that money you'd just buy one game, and if you don't care having it only in digital it's the best deal ever.<br /><br />I got my code in 5 minutes tops, a great alternative for those who don't have a Credit/Debit Card from the US. And you get stuff for the PS4 and PS Vita too (well there's not much for those yet, but you still can see the holy word &#34;free&#34; floating around)<br /><br />One thing that goes perfect with your year membership of PS+ is a new HardDrive, seriously look for one, there's tutorials on youtube and it's easy, having at leat 1TB of space will take the most of your money!
