There is simply no reasonable, no acceptable, and no VALID excuse for how EA has handled the debacle which followed the release of what should have been their biggest hit in 10 years!  No excuse.  NONE!<br /><br />EA has taken a fantastic company like Maxis and flushed them down the toilet through their corporate paranoia and mistrust of the very customers who made them the financial giant they were for so long.<br /><br />HEY EA! WHAT THE HELL DID WE EVER DO TO YOU TO DESERVE YOU TREATING US WITH SUCH DISREGARD?<br /><br />Folks, EA has not even apologized for the delays, the down servers, the loss of any cities you created only to go into the game and be told its \\"No Longer Accessible\\".  NOT EVEN APOLOGIZED!  NOT ONCE!  NEVER EVEN CAME CLOSE!<br /><br />And giving us a free game for our trouble?  If I WANTED one of those other games, I'd have BOUGHT one of those other games!  I WANT SIMCITY 5 to work as well as SIMCITY 4!!!  Why is that an unreasonable expectation?<br /><br />Clearly EA has no regard for its customers.  They made their money, they figure this catastrophe will be forgotten in time and they'll have their cash.  Guess what EA...in the age of the Internet, that doesn't happy anymore.<br /><br />This will NOT be forgotten.  It will NOT be forgiven.  And you will NEVER AGAIN have our trust nor our loyalty.<br /><br />There are too many other places for us to spend our gaming dollars and too many ways for us to have fun WITHOUT giving you our money.<br /><br />Want to know the real cost of this EA?  Wait to see what happens the next time you want to run a major launch...you've know idea what's still to come.<br /><br />EA, you get to decide what happens here, but we, the customers, will ALWAYS get the last word.
