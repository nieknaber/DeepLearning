So I was feeling a bit nostalgic and wanted to play Roller Coaster Tycoon.  Unfortunately, I do not have the disc with me here at college.  I didn't really want to repurchase a game I already had, but then I found out that there's a sequel!  The game plays exactly like the original (with improvements of course).  There are more rides, different scenarios, and better user interface.  Plus this version has the two expansions, so there's even more content to enjoy.<br /><br />Also, I chose this game over Roller Coaster Tycoon 3 because that game too different from the original.  I downloaded demos of RCT2 and RCT3, and I had more fun with RCT2.
