I played this game for an hour or two on XBOX at my buddies place, loads of fun. Certainly a little different from the usual video game. You are probably watching 95% of the time, the rest you are making choices and fighting off a few zombies.<br /><br />What I liked the most about this game is that it has a real feel, in the sense that some choices are better than others, and if you know a thing or two about the zombie genre, you probably have a good idea what the best course of action is to take, and see how that works out for you.<br /><br />HOW WOULD YOU DO IF YOU WERE IN KIRKMAN'S UNIVERSE? YOU THINK YOU KNOW THE RIGHT CHOICES TO MAKE? FIND OUT!!!
