I downloaded the PC version using all defaults. I ran the patch to 1.05 when 1.04 wouldn't activate.<br /><br />I can log into Bioware site and it shows the game is registered.<br /><br />I tried several downloads/installs. No luck. I just get the \\"there is a problem with your install.. reinstall\\" message<br /><br />Reading other reviews, this is a problem that Amazon and EA and Bioware have FAILED TO ADDRESS for YEARS.<br /><br />I subsequently bought the exact same thing from Steam. Absolutely NO PROBLEMS.<br /><br />I would not recommend Amazon Download to my WORST ENEMY.
