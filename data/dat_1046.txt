Tried to play this game, but no words can describe how mediocre it is.<br />1.  No save feature<br />2.  No pausing in the game so dont press escape or start otherwise u start the whole game over what???<br />3.  Ps1 graphics even on max settings<br />4.  No map or even a quest marker or options of where to go... nothing. Your just exploring an orphanage and have to be lucky to find stuff<br /><br />Conclusion: i got this game for free (2 copies) otherwise no way in hell i would buy it.<br /><br />Stick to outlast and the amnesia games for a real scare or creep fest. otherwise until this game is fixed its really bad.
