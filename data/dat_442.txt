I bought this game and played it  for literally hours, I had to go to Wal-Mart and purchase the whole set with FF1,FF2,FF3,Pizza party,American Pie,Ice Age, Russian Roulette, Madagascar,Gone Fishing and Ancient Rome. And it had a bonus game called My Farm Life.. These games are so fun. They are a good time killer to... I love them and can't wait to get more games.. :-) Thanks Amazon...
