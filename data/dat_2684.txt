It's a good story wise and such, but the PC port controls are terrible.<br />There is no auto attack.<br />The tactical view is so bad that's it's nearly unusable.<br />And since combat is a major portion of the game, it's very tedious and frustrating.<br />I would return the game if I had the possibility.
