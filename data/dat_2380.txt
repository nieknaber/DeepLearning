Before i played this game my life had no flavor. Every day was just one grey blur. I was alive but not &#34;living&#34;. The day i got the Handsome Collection, that all changed. Every day is a gift. I i have a new enthusiasm that has paid dividends even outside my gaming life. In the month since i got the collection, i have noticed a sharp raise in my IQ. Around 50 points. My bench press has gone up by 150 lbs and i now smell like a fresh meadow all the time. I highly reccomend this game
