UPDATE  7-July-2012:  Maybe I was a bit hasty in my initial review (seen below).  After considering the game further, I see now that indeed this game has a lot going for it.  I have come to appreciate how the mechanics have changed.  For example, I see now the evolution of this genre and how StrongHold3 is a good next step.  Consider the use of farming.  It is now possible to grab multiple towns and then have towns specialize in making specific goods and transporting them to you.  Thus the economoy mechanics are in fact more interesting that in previous games without being more complex.  A good enhancement.  I guess I just did not give the game enough of a chance at first and it took me some time to appreciate what I had in front of me.  I have upped my rating one point.  The other faults are still there (bad voice acting, incomprehensible plot, etc.), but there is more to the game than the campaign mode lets on.<br /><br />Hail Flavius!<br /><br />What I like:<br /><br />The graphics are nice.  But then so were the graphics from the original.<br /><br />There are many similarities to this and the original.  It takes some time to get used to the different buildings and production chains.  And it is way more difficult to figure out how to fine tune your economy.  This may take considerably more observation on my part before I figure out the details.  But being able to bring forward a lot of what was in the original is a good thing.<br /><br />I like the ability to auto-sell though in the military campaign, not all things you make are sellable which makes using it less advantageous.<br /><br />The \\"COMIC BOOK\\" style presentation was a neat idea.  It is uninteresting in its current form.  But it was a neat idea so I give them credit for trying to tell the story this way.  Maybe a different take on it would work better.<br /><br />What I don't like:<br /><br />The voice acting is really bad as is a goodly amount of the story dialog.  Some actors it seems tried, but mostof it is dull and without emotion.  You really get a sense that the voice was done remotely, by many actors who never once got together.  They all did it by email.  Here... read these lines.  We will combine them with recorded lines from other actors later.  I understand the economics of this, but one has to wonder if these actors were as confused by the plot as game users are and thus they did not know when to emote.<br /><br />The plot is quite confusing and not at all engrossing.  There was no need to bring back the \\"OLD ENEMIES\\"; they could easily have created a different more complelling story and told it better.<br /><br />There is no control over the speed aka. no speed slider.  Thus you have basically \\"medium\\" speed with no way to get past boring moments, and no way to create think time.<br /><br />The AI is just as dumb as in the original.  All scenarios where you are defending, you just have to build an army and wait for time to pass till you have eliminated all troups that come to you, or you have achieved your timed goal.<br /><br />Concluding Remarks:<br /><br />I am just confused.  How can a development team make a new addition to a game series, and not understand what made the original game so good.  Did they not play the original and compare it to what they were building to set goals and weigh their new product?<br /><br />And how can a game have so much missing from it.  Consider for example, that there was no \\"ATTACK MOVE\\" move in the first release of Stronghold 3.  It took several update releases before they added it.  I can't for the life of me figure out how this game could have been playable without it.<br /><br />Overall, the lack of a recognizable plot, and the poor voice work, make it impossible to really get into the game.  Nothing about this game \\"DRAWS YOU IN\\" like the original Stronghold did.  Thus it is just not worth playing.<br /><br />Hail Flavius!
