Console port all the way.    The combat camera is horrible ... stinks of a console port. This is CERTAINLY NOT DA: Origin.    The inventory is wonky ... so hard to use which is crazy because it's a PC and should be the easiest to use. Why can't we have an inventory ala Diablo 3 or Skyrim?    The crafting system is impossible to understand ... and I have been playing RPGs since the days of MS DOS.    The game looks incredible and has a ton of potential, IF!!!! If they properly address the UI. I would wait a few weeks before buying. Look to see if the patches are sufficient.    Ugh ... waste of $60 right now.      ...This is absolutely the last time I ever buy a day 1 game from EA/Bioware again.
