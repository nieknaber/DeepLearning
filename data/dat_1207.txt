Why I love this game:<br /><br />It's flawless in every way and anyone that says it isn't can jump into a hole in the ground specifically dug for a person 7/8 his size.  Also, I want to say that the soundtrack contained so much grown-up metal that I literally burst with pleasure.<br /><br />Bon appetit and goodnight!
