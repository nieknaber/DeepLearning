I would not typically call myself a \\"casual gamer,\\" but a friend urged me to check out Poker Smash.  I never expected to be so hooked!  It's a unique spin on Tetris and playing-cards.  Don't worry if you know nothing about card games or poker (like myself).  I picked it up immediately.  Game sessions can get intense!  Great with a group of friends or simply in solitude passing time.
