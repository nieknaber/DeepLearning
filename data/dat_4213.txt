nothing wrong with a playstation gift card, but if you are prompted to buy this card for payment of a product, offered by an outside website that claimed to be attached to Amazon.  i was tricked, and don't want anyone else to fall for this too good to be true offering of unbelievably cheap products to attract us.  just beware.
