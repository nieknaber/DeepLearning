I've just completed this game after playing it quite religiously over the past few weeks.<br />It reminds me of a Hong Kong GTA in style, with focus on city life, lots of driving, fighting and gang related missions.<br />The combat is not too disimilar to that of Batman Arkham Asylum/City with the variety of combat moves to be unlocked and use to defeat varied types of enemies.<br />Hand to hand combat in fact makes up more of the combat overall than gunplay which makes a nice change and can make it a little harder.<br />Driving is fun and there are a lot of differing powered cars (and bikes) to choose from and they can also be a weapon when used to ram enemies or to shoot out of with a firearm. This too can be said for boats as well.<br />The characters are interesting and you notice a progression as you work your way up through the Triad organization and interact with more complex and intelligent characters, however some do make appearances throughout the game allowing you to get more attached to them.<br />There is a considerable amount of satisfaction in the unlock system which lets you unlock a variety of new skills from your performance in missions relating to your police, and triad ratings. This simultaneously adds a degree of replayability in order to improve your score to unlock, whilst giving you the added bonus of competing against your friends on Steam for the numerous stat based achievements - alongside the missions and races.<br />The combat moves are unlocked through finding certain items across the map which are unlocked as you play through in some part. The unlocking also works hand in hand with progressing in the game, which allows you to finish missions with more ease due to the wider range of skills and stat boosts they provide.<br />Money can be used to purchase clothes, cars and temporary stat boosts in the form of food and drink. The cars expand your garage selection and the clothes grant you both a different look and also the benefit of statbonuses upon wearing 'sets' of clothes.<br /><br />The game supports Nvidia 3D Vision relatively well in game, some cut scenes suffer slightly upon objects in the foreground throwing off the 3D and sometimes the subtitles which are needed due to the rare Chinese speech sections of the game.<br />However the main play of the game is done well in 3D and high speed chases on motorcycles gives you that thrill of speed and danger as objects whizz past. Turning this on does put extra strain on the PC and meant that I needed to turn down the graphics settings from Hard to Normal.<br /><br />All in all a very enjoyable game, could be a little bit longer in terms of the storyline but with great graphics, decent physics and sound with the benefit of a nice selection of music for the radio stations.
