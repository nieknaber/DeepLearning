I was bored at work so I downloaded the game and played it to kill some time.  The gameshow host (dressed in white with poof of blond hair)is rather annoying and the game is not anything new.  I prefer Cooking Dash to Hot Dog Hotshot.  I didn't find the graphics all that great and yes I know they are suppose to look that cartoony way.  Also, I found the upgrades rather limiting.  You start out only making hotdogs; however, you can eventually get hamburgers.  Aside from some various toppings like mushrooms, oninions and eggs...there's not much in the way of new stuff to prepare and the mushrooms, eggs, oninions are only put in a pan until ready then placed on the burger/hotdog.  You do get onionrings and fries and three beverages to serve.  The beverages are already made drinks in bottles.
