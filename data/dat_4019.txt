This download version of TS2014 requires the user to establish a Steam account to complete registration AND to use the game. This is only indirectly mentioned in the fine print of the Terms of Use. Even there it is not specifically given as a requirement for this game. I am very disappointed Amazon!<br /><br />Follow-up: In fairness, Amazon promptly responded to my email concerning the inadequate information in the product description. The issue has been forwarded to the \\"concerned department\\". However, pointing out that this is identified as a \\"steam(sic) download\\" with the notation \\"DRM: Steam\\" doesn't seem very satisfying.<br /><br />Product note: I found this to be little, if any, improvement over the original MS TrainSim. It's a different locale and trainset but the jerky graphics and overall modest quality world scenery are the same. Very disappointing.
