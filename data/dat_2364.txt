I played Arkham Asylum, and it was amazin. This heavy feeling of being hunted, then being a hunter, Scarecrow levels, and discovering Asyum history was everything i would want from a game. Then it came Arkham City, which, beside Old Gotham leves, and fights with Ras-al Ghul ( well okay, fight with Madhatter was also a blast ) didn't have even a fraction of his predecesor power....<br /><br />And then came Arkham Origins. Game sooooo bugged, that most of the critics gave her lowest possible notes. And it was true, to smoe part. Bugs ware searious, but now, after God only knows how many patches, you can play fine. At least i didn't find any in my 19 hr's in Gotham... Also, the game work just fine on Windows XP :) What wil you get ?<br /><br />- Great cutscenes, a lot better that in two previous parts<br />- More agressiv Batman, it's been ony two years, since he taken his role as a crimefighter, see how he violatas human rights yourself<br />- New toys, which are old toys, two new things are concusion charge - absoluty useless, and electro gauntlest - absolutly great.<br />- See the first encounter of Dark Knight and the World Greates Cloun. Yes, in this part Joker makes his first apperance in Gotham, and he rocks. Also voice acting is great, it's not Mark Hammil, but you can feel the maddnes :)<br />- See young Gordon, as he tries to take down Batman, and meet his daughter... Sorry Batgirl fans, not in this game...<br />Embark on epic quest, to safe Gotham from bunch of assasins, each have it's own style, whats more, two of them are OPTIONAL, yes, you don't need to fight them, bu you will propably want to....<br />-Riddle me this: whats green, smart smart and loves to infuriat you with those hidden colectibles ? Yes, the Riddler aldo make his first apperance, and, at least for me, he's a lot better. No more whole city looking like christmas tree becasue of he's marks, see for yourself.<br />-Safe Alfreds life<br />-Beat the cops ( they taking bribes, so it's okay )<br />-Change Batsuites<br />-Fight Freeze in the new DLC<br />-Kick Bane's ass, but this time he's a lot more powerfull that before...
