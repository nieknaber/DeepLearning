This is a great RPG-Shooter.  It's very similar to Fallout 3 and has a lot of the RPG elements of Diablo. (you can play an area over and over as it replenishes each time you play)  It's not overly hard so it's not frustrating for the average gamer.  It has a fun, not too serious story.  The game has lots of gore and bad language, but it's not all that \\"dark\\".  It's more of a funny/filthy.<br /><br />It requires STEAM, which I loathe, but seems to be an average \\"evil\\" these days when it comes to DRM.  You need a fast internet connection or don't even bother.
