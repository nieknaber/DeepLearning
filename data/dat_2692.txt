Dream Day Wedding Bella Italia is a beautifully rendered game with wonderful music.  I have played all the other Dream Day Wedding games, and this is my favorite.   It is loaded with hidden objects and other challenges which I found highly entertaining and none impossible. It is a very long game with good replay value.      When you play the game for the first time, you have the choice of playing a regular timed game (adequate...not too demanding as timers go) or in a relaxed mode with no time restriction.  (The scenes are so crisp and well drawn, it is nice to drink them in at least once without thinking about the clock.)  In both of these initially available modes, you may skip any mini games, if you wish.     If you need more time on the clock, just find three or more objects and click on them rather quickly, and time will be added to your \\"countdown.\\"  Also, to get more hints, find all the bluebirds, or as many as you can, in each scene.    After you complete one of the two initially available modes, a \\"seasoned traveler\\" option opens where you are playing the same game story, but with more items to find, stiffer time restrictions and no skip feature on the mini games.     Each time you play, the list of items to find changes a bit or where they are hidden isn't always in the same place, so it does have fairly good replay value and won't bore you silly if you wish to try the game again to select different dress, cake and floral arrangement options for the wedding.    It's a gorgeous and relaxing game experience, and one I return to to unwind....like taking a little vacation.    If you go to other gaming sites and read the reviews, you will find this game ranks among the best. Enjoy.  It is well worth the money.
