I received the email with the activation code a few minutes after I purchased the membership. After stumbling around the Xbox trying to activate Xbox live, and waiting for a few updates to cycle through, I figured out how to do it and am up and running. No problems to report so far. Netflix streams nicely and I tried the CW TV channel app and it works nicely.
