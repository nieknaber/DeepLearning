I bought two of these up during the Black Friday sale. I received both codes within a minute of placing my order.<br /><br />I heard people were having issues redeeming them on their PS4s so I waited a few days. Once I did try to redeem, the code was accepted without any issues.<br /><br />Thanks Amazon! I am glad I didn't have to visit GameStop in order to get these at such a great price.
