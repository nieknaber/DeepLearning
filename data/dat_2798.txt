I love Sim City. I've played every iteration of the game all the way back to the original one on my SNES.<br /><br />In fact, in anticipation for this one, I booted up my old CD copy of Sim City 2000. It was a hoot to play.<br /><br />Flash to the release of Sim City 5. There are many amazing things in the game. The graphics, the all-new style and the excellent design and mechanics of the game.<br /><br />Then there's the awful stuff... the DRM that punishes users by forcing them to always stay online. The forced requirement to interact with other players...<br /><br />I really, really feel for the people who built this game. There was a ton of great work and ideas put into the game, all ruined by EA's forced mandate to play online.<br /><br />In 20 years, no one who pays for a legitimate copy of Sim City 5 will be able to play it while my copy of Sim City 2000 will always work. Sigh.
