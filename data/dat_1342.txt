It came out of nowhere and I didn't know anything about it. I took a chance on it and I'm so glad I did!<br /><br />It's a 3D platformer (a rarity for the PC these days) along the lines of Mario 64/Sunshine but with a decidedly Pac-Man spin. All the basics are there, chomping ghosts, power pills, fruit etc but much expanded on of course.<br /><br />And it all works really well to make for a ridiculously fun game. I never though I would be playing Pac-man in 3D in a chameleon costume trying to shoot a long sticky tongue at ghosts while being on multi-layered conveyor belts moving in different directions but it was great!<br /><br />The game is laid out with multiple areas each with a map with levels that you progress through, very much like a Mario game. You can also go back to the school (a home base basically), talk to the various characters and when you earn enough fruit by completing levels play various mini-games on arcade machines.<br /><br />Speaking of school, the story. Pac-man is in high school. And he's friends with Inky, Blinky, Pinky and Clyde, and a few other assorted characters. Don't think about it too hard. Actually, it's supposed to be based on a new Pac-Man cartoon series which I haven't seen and the game just sort of assumes you are familiar with the setting and characters which by the way can be a bit hokey in a kids show sort of way at times. Still what the game lacks in expository dialogue or deep story it more than makes up for in gameplay and fun factor.<br /><br />Unlike so many games these days it's not ball bustingly hard which is great for people like me who want a fun game you can play leisurely with a moderate degree of challenge without being frustrated. It also would be great for kids and there's absolutely nothing objectionable in the game. That being said, people looking for a very high degree of challenge might not be satisfied. I'll have to see how the game goes in the higher levels but for right now for me it's in a Goldilocks spot of being just right for challenge without being too much of a cake walk or too excruciatingly hard.<br /><br />From a technical standpoint the options are very scarce, as console ports frequently are, however the game looks excellent visually for the style it's going for, runs very smooth and I had zero issues with it all unlike some other console ports I've tried.<br /><br />I've used a (360) controller and the game handles great that way. I'm assuming it at least has token keyboard and mouse support but I can't even imagine playing it without a controller. It would feel odd to me.<br /><br />This is a really well made fun game that looks and plays great. Much higher quality than most games I've played lately, though admittedly I tend to play a lot of indie stuff.
