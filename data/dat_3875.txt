This is a classic hidden object game but with story, dialogues and some very nice high res scenes. The locations are very different, you play from London to Transylvania, and some of them look pretty authentic.<br />From the first scene there are hidden objects to find, first by word and then by picture. Within each hos there are pop ups for mini games which are fun. The artwork/graphics have a painting quality which I found pleasing and well done. If you like Victorian novels you'll appreciate how the story is delivered.<br />There are three difficulties to choose. On hard you don't have hints and cannot skip minigames or scenes. It can be a challenge! The objects are well hidden, but still always fair.<br />If you have a powerful computer, you can switch to a higher quality of the graphics, a feature not usual to this kind of games.<br />I recommend the game to all HOG fans.
