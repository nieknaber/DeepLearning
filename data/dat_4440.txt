takes huge space and requires downloading new software. The result is very disappointing.  Navigation within the program is difficult and not consistent. Cannot go to other games once you open the program and chose one game. Tons of completely useless features -- huge library of backgrounds and music for example, and and lack of features and options that you really need -- like cards appearance and size.
