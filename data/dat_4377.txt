I'm always skeptical of games based on movies, television and comics because they so rarely turn out well. As longtime fan of the Walking Dead comic and recent fan of the show, that skepticism was sky high when I heard that a game based on them was being created. After seeing the game be listed on several best of the year lists and finding it on sale, I decided to give it a shot. It turned out to be one of the best gaming decisions I made in a long time. This game is so much fun and does a great job of making you care about the characters as the story progresses. Anyone who's on the fence should definitely give this game a chance.
