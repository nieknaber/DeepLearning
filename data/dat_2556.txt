30-second flavor intro:<br />The Secret World (TSW): Join a secret society in resisting the coming darkness, fight back against the horror-harbingers of the apocalypse, and discover your hidden power over melee, guns, and magic. Globe-hop between Lovecraftian locations seen in the present day (circa 2012, Mayan end of days). Meet offbeat characters and alien-mythical monsters inspired by Stephen King, X-Files, Cthulhu Mythos, mystic cults and conspiracy (non)theories, cult and pulp fiction.<br /><br />(If you haven't heard of it, check out SCP-wiki.net for extra fun flavor re: end times, occult, eldritch/artifact horror, secret societies. No official relation to TSW, but very very similar themes and modern setting).<br /><br />Factions/PVP:<br />There are three secret society factions to choose from, factions in a loose alliance vs. the outsider threat, but with different motivations and feel, and competing interests (faction combat for PVP, but PVE content you can group w/ anybody). You've got the puppetmaster/shadow manipulator Illuminati working through corporations and media, the militaristic-religious-traditional Templar order, and the chaos-theory agents of mystic probability that make up the Dragon.<br /><br />Gameplay, selected highlights/overview:<br /><br />Clothes/Armor customizability:<br />TSW offers a ton of customizability in costume and in combat. Clothes are cosmetic only so you can dress up how you like out of the dozens of pieces for each of the 9 body slots (head, face, torso, legs, shoes, and coat being the major ones). You can buy clothes w/ various play-to-earn currencies (missions and dungeons by zone, PVP by battlefield) or by buying pay-to-get currency, there's a separate in-game clothing store for each type of currency, with distinct looks. &#34;Armor&#34; comes in the form of non-visible talismans, one for each of 7 slots, that affect your various stats.<br /><br />No Subscription Fee, pay for content, cosmetic, and small temporary XP boosts:<br />BTW the game's business model is no sub fee, you pay once for mission/area content packs, and you can buy pay-to-get currency for clothes, pets, to get the permanent speed upgrades early or more character slots, or to get small temporary XP boosts. It's a pretty fair balance for those with more time or more money without killing the experience for either (slow slow grind or pay2win easy).<br /><br />Combat and Classless, customizable &#34;deck&#34; system:<br />Combat is fast-paced and mobile (with only one &#34;deck&#34; of 7 active abilities to manage at any time, and probably only 3-4 of those abilities to consider depending on combat situation, plus 1 or 2 emergency/support abilities). The classless system is so deep I'll just say it's similar to Magic the Gathering deckbuilding. It's actually called &#34;deckbuilding&#34; in TSW, and it's a pretty engaging aspect of the game (that you can get a shortcut into by following premade &#34;decks&#34; in-game or elsewhere online). You can also change decks any time out of combat to change your combat role (tank, heal, support; but also three ways to do each) or approach (melee or ranged) (single or aoe).<br /><br />There isn't much reason for having alt characters except to see the other faction storylines or to have a toon in a different sex. Aside from the faction story, main and side missions are daily repeatable and easy to share.<br /><br />Missions:<br />Extra special mention for one type of main (and occasional story) mission: Investigations. These are unique to TSW, and are basically riddles that frequently take on alternate reality game aspects (with clues found in real-world information as well as fake websites on the real WWW, and an in-game web browser). Investigations are very immersive but can also be frustrating, fortunately they are optional, you still get plenty of XP doing other missions, and investigations are color-coded in questgiver lists and in the journal. Besides Investigations you've got your usual kill X, collect Y, defend Z, mixed up a bit w/ a variety of monster types and groups to get in your way. The mission flow isn't as fluid as Star Wars TOR but it still moves fairly briskly. Main missions are available from NPCs (who are each voiced and have distinct offbeat personalities), side missions are found on objects scattered in the environment.
