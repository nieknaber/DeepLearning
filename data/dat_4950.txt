Having an option to add $10 at a time to your PSN wallet is good if you need to add a little at a time instead of a full 20 or $50. I have ordered quite a few of these from Amazon, and have been emailed the code very quickly after I placed my order. I would highly recommend ordering the codes online because you will probably redeem a physical code and just throw the card away anyways.
