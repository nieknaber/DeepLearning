This open world game is very interesting, the school, the town, the atmosphere, and the characters.  I found it very interesting until (Spoiler Alert) Jimmy looses his popularity and is hated.  I found this to have been a waste of what I had done already in the game, but it was a good storyline.  I wasn't swayed by this however, and this is one of my favorite video games.
