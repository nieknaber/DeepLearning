I wanted to update this review. After dealing with all of the server issues the first week I came home from an even worse slap from EA after vacation this past week. I find that my copy of Simcity has now vanished from EA. EA responded by telling me that there was a chargeback. Amazon support was very helpful and friendly. They stated they would look into it, but it might take a few days. I place ZERO blame on amazon for this. I think that EA is not wanting to shell out anymore free money for a product they didn't deliver on.<br /><br />Bottom line. Don't buy any EA game. Don't support a company that can't put all of their \\"updates\\" in one place. They have links all over their forums that point to different tidbits of information on where things are. Their customer service is horrible.<br /><br />This is my last EA purchase ever.
