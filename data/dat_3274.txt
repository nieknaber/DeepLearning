This game will not work on my computer no matter the number of recommended fixes I tried.  I bought it again on the disk and tried the game on my mother's computer and it works fine.  It's a nice game I like making my own people, dressing them, naming them, decorating the buildings. This is a game you can spend hours playing and never realize it.
