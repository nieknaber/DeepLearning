Tried to buy plex for a friend, did some research and per the eve forums was told I needed to buy an Eve Time Code, that was sold through amazon. I believe this system has changed since the posts were made, as I did not find an ETC to buy. Now you can by Plex, but you will need the recipient's login an password to send it to him, or if you have your own account, buy it for yourself then give it to him/her in the game. As a non player buying this stuff for a friend, the system was confusing.
