This game is pretty great. I love the business aspect of it, as you can run your fire station and make a profit. You can also decorate your station, and I think that is really the best part. You can hire (or fire) different firefighters or EMTs, and assign them jobs around the station. However, in order to keep the game going, you need to pass missions. The first few are rather easy, but they get harder. The missions themselves are not hard, but the timer is. For example, you need to individually extract 25 people from a train wreck, have a paramedic examine them, and devote 2 paramedics to drive them to the ER, and assign firefighters to put out the raging forest fire behind it all. In 10 minutes. That is as far as I got, because I can't even get half of it done in the time allowed. The only really good part about it is station management, but nothing happens unless you go into call mode, where no more than a minute passes in between calls. Anyway, I don't really recommend this game, unless they get rid of the timer.
