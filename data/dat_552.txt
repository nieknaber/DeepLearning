I can't recommend this game enough. While it's definitely dated (and the PC port was only moderately well done, at best), and the online community is all but nonexistent this late in it's lifetime, those things don't really matter enough to sway my love for this game.<br /><br />It's a huge, open world driving game with arcade-like controls and has a ton of content. Every time I play for a few minutes for old time's sake, I leave with a huge grin on my face. The soundtrack is kickin' as well, and in the end this is a great game if you can get it at a good price.<br /><br />If you have a racing wheel, then it rivals the old arcade machines of old, even.<br />It's that fun.
