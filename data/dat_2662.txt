I had to come back and update my review now that Maxis/EA have made some drastic improvements in the performance of their servers.  Despite the fact that you have to be connected to a server to play the single-player version of the game, I've quickly grown to love this game.  I played it yesterday for about 6 hours and did not experience any connectivity issues.  I did hold my breath a couple times when a little connectivity alert appeared for a brief time but game play didn't suffer because of it.<br /><br />I am staggered by the real-time mathematical models running underneath the gorgeous graphical front-end.  It's fascinating to watch a large city in action - I especially like to watch the Education map when school opens in the morning.<br /><br />So, if you have access to robust broadband internet, and you are a fan of Sims/SimCity, and have a patient personality for coping with the current server availability issues, then I think you will enjoy this game.  I certainly am.<br /><br />~~ Original Review ~~<br />There are no servers available, so I've spent $60 on a game I can not play.  DO NOT BUY! You can not play this game unless you have a live connection to one of their servers.  The mandatory beginning tutorial loads, and DOES NOTHING.  Complete and total fail, and waste of money.
