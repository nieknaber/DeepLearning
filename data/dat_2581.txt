This game is very scary. Whether it is the mentally insane popping out at you or chasing you, or even checking out a room with your night vision camera, outlast has lots to offer. If you have a pc or ps4, this game is definitely worth the price. P.S. its even better playing it in the dark and with gaming headphones, if you dare.
