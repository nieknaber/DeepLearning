I understand people got a bad taste in their mouth about this game at launch I know I was there, but the game has improved so much since then its now an entirely different game. I recommend old players to return to the game on May 9th where SE is hosting their free 10 day trial. Also they announced the legacy program which gives very nice bonuses to loyal FFXIV players. Including a discounted monthly membership for the lifetime of the game and more. If you were a fan of FFXI like I was. You'll see how this game has captured some of that magic for FFXIV and its only getting better with 2.0 around the corner. At 10-20 bucks right now why not? It only will go back up to full retail price of 49.99-59.99 once 2.0 arrives. If your choosing a server I recommend Ridill. Lots of former FFXI players on there and many helpful players.
