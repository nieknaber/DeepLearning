I was surprised how much I enjoyed the game.  Team work is key in this game, so rambo heroics don't really   get you far.   The game doesn't do much to stand out against such a crowded genre, but   this is one fun game.   The graphics are ok and they do the job, and since this is a source engine  game it runs pretty good on lower end systems.   Overall I recommend this game to anyone that enjoys team oriented FPS.
