Ever since I first read about The Cave, the new downloadable game released by Double Fine Productions, I had high hopes for it.  After all, it was developed by the amazing Ron Gilbert, the genius behind many retro adventure games, including The Secret of Monkey Island, Day of the Tentacle and even my all-time favorite video game, Maniac Mansion.  I was also a fan of Double Fine's other works, Psychonauts and Brutal Legend, so based on the quality work I've seen from the collaborators behind this idea, I was already sold.<br /><br />Like Maniac Mansion, The Cave offers you seven playable characters to choose from before starting your expedition.  Well, it's technically eight if you count the pair of little twins, although they never leave one another's side and still function as a single unit.  Other characters include blatant stereotypes of a hillbilly, a knight, a time-traveller, a scientist, an adventurer and even a monk.  You can choose three for your journey into the cave, using any combination of characters you'd like.<br /><br />Your playthrough will vary based on the people you choose.  Each playable character has a unique ability, such as the hillbilly being able to hold his breath for a long period of time, making him the only character who can traverse underwater for great distances.  They also have their own character-specific levels, such as the knight's castle or the adventurer's pyramid.  Their talents will mostly come into play in their own levels, and you will only explore a particular level if its character is in your party.<br /><br />The puzzles offer little difficulty, at least compared to adventure games of the past.  I think Double Fine wanted to make the game more accessible to casual gamers, rather than only adventure game enthusiasts.  As such, there is no inventory system, and characters can only carry one item at a time.  However, these items you find can only be used in their respective areas, so it's pretty easy to figure out what to do with particular objects.  At the least, you might have to do some backtracking once you realize where something goes, but it's not too laborious as like I said, each section of the cave is a fairly confined area with its own unique items.<br /><br />None of the selectable characters speak at all.  I guess the idea was to keep them mysterious as you slowly learn their dirty secrets throughout your playthrough.  Their backstories are revealed via \\"cave paintings\\" you find scattered throughout the levels.  Fortunately, they aren't hard to find, and you'll most likely collect them all by the end of your run.  These cave paintings are humorously-drawn images, each one showing another tidbit in that character's story.  I found all of the stories to have a dark comedy feel to them, which I really enjoyed.<br /><br />It's not a quiet game, though.  The cave itself is, in fact, a talking cave, one with a sense of humor to boot.  It talks to you throughout your entire adventure, cracking jokes and making witty observations the whole time.  I thought he was rather funny and really added to the experience.  In fact, it's probably the best character in the game.<br /><br />I would have liked better endings for the playable characters, though.  I liked the cave drawings and their humorous imagery, but rather than having the endings be just another cave drawing showing what happened, I'd have loved to see something animated.  I will say though that the endings were all great resolutions to their respective stories, but I noticed that they were all dark as hell.  It wasn't until I started working on unlocking the trophies/achievements when I realized that each character has both a good and a bad ending, and I had gotten all the bad ones.  Before leaving the cave in the end, your character claims an object representing their biggest desires, and evidently you can return it to the cave's gift shop to get the \\"good\\" ending, which offers alternate ending panels with happier outcomes.<br /><br />Of course, that means you would have to play through the game multiple times with each person to get their full stories.  If you're an achievement or trophy hunter like me, though, it won't be that big of a deal.  After playing through already, you'll know exactly what to do and you'll be able to just breeze right through it.  The gameplay is pretty linear, which makes replaying levels pretty easy.  In Maniac Mansion, for example, there are many ways to end the game, and so many objects to find, a lot of which serve no purpose.  As a result, I played through Mansion about a million times, whereas I was done with The Cave as soon as I unlocked the trophies and saw everyone's endings.<br /><br />For a final score, I'd give The Cave a solid 4 out of 5.  I thought the game was funny, unique and featured fun platforming and interesting levels to explore.  It's also reasonably priced and definitely worth your time.  I just felt it was a little hindered by the lack of depth compared to previous adventure games, and I would have liked a few more areas to explore.  In any case, I think it's a great game, and although Ron Gilbert has since left Double Fine (stating how he only joined the company to direct this particular title), I do hope he'll work on more games like this in the future.r /><br />Of course, that means you would have to play through the game multiple times with each person to get their full stories.
