Like with the Hd Stardust PS3 game which felt like a new and vastly better graphics version of Asteroids this game feels like a newer version of another long and fondly remembered game Defender.There really isn't plot or character development in the game like we've seen with most games but it'll give gamers what they want, a good time.  The controls are pretty straight forward as is the objective. So for the current price I'd say this is worth getting for any PS4 owner.
