simcity had a bad start...  but the game itself is pretty good.  there are a few things I would like them to fix as the maps are small.  that would be ok if sharing of services could be relied on like reliable power from other cities or garbage..  police.  you get the idea.  water problems are a bit of a pain it would be nice to have rain to replenish some water...all In all the game is fun though and the minor issues will get worked out I believe.  definately a good game to buy at this point.
