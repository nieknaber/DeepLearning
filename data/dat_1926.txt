The down load was fast and easy however the flippers were not in sync with the game so I contacted the Help Line. The response was quick and it explained that only some graphic cards experience this problem and they were working on a fix and would let me know when it was done. That was Feb 24 and I have not heard from them yet. I do not use the game and will not until it works the way it was intended.
