This is the first time I've had to actually download one of the FFXI expansions. But anyway..<br /><br />Once I got it installed and such, and the expansion went live, I can say Square has the beginnings of what could be a winner, but since they update and add more to expansions over time for this game, it's WAY too close to call. Ask me again after a few updates and I may have a different opinion. Especially if they are slow with content updates. If they drag updates out like the last expansion (Wings of the Goddess took three years to complete!), it will prolly stink.
