If I could give less than one star I would give that. Amazon should not sell something that does not work. No guarantee anything.<br /><br />When writing all the alphanumeric code on the playstation store, code provided through the mail... (After I took longer than expected get the code from amazon). (Over an hour). Jumped an error message saying; An error has occurred. So I could not redeem the code that I bought for a year of Plus membership.<br /><br />This is the second time that a code provided by Amazon does not work to me. The first time was, with the pre-order of God of War Ascension. Frankly I am disappointed with the service provided by Amazon with their digital downloads.<br /><br />M Nicholas (From Customer Service) said: Please try again over the next few hours...<br /><br />I tried again... Twice, with the same result, an error message saying &#34;An error has occurred.&#34;<br /><br />Bantu M (From Customer Service) said: Please try again over the next few hours.<br /><br />I tried again... three times, with the same result, an error message saying &#34;An error has occurred.&#34;<br /><br />Amazon should not offer something that does not work. Customer trust towards the company breaks down completely. Proof of this is that... Since March 31, I stopped buying games at Amazon for the bitter swill I spent through &#34;God of War Ascension&#34; when the pre-order codes not work for me. And that's why ... I bought this game on pre-order ... Just for the pre-order bonus.<br /><br />And from now on I will not buy any products with digital download on Amazon. Just because... Would be like throwing money away.
