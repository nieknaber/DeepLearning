Recently after release of the game I have come to wanting to buy this.<br /><br />Unfortunately I didn't give a damn so bought it close to 2 years later... This product is awful as soon as it came into my life my appeal towards others has changed completely. Being that I am a hyper-intelligent walrus with fingers I find that this game has torn me from my family and destroyed my social life. GET OUT WHILE YOU CAN.<br /><br />PS. Great graphics though.
