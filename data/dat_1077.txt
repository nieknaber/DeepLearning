I had to rate this product a 3, not because it's a bad product, but because the item description isn't very clear, if you already own a 4th backpack slot it doesn't give you a fifth one, instead that part of your purchase is just thrown away.  Overall a decent addition to the LOTRO account.  The riding skill for all your characters and a horse not only saves you quite a bit of time, money and TP points but can make the game so much better to play.
