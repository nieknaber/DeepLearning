The downloaded version works great. I had no trouble downloading and installing. There is an update to wait through before playing, but it takes about the right amount of time to kiss up to the wife before gaming non-stop for several days. Buy her some cho-co-la-te before you install the game. It'll give her something to do.<br />This game is so addicting I lost two days to it. My wife is asking if I'm alright.<br /><br />\\"Si,\\" I answer. \\"I jost haf to beeld una mas factory before deener.\\"<br />\\"OK, Honey. We're at the table waiting for you.\\"<br />\\"That's Senor Presidente to joo, mami linda.\\"<br />Buy the game. Run your own island country.<br />The people are so friendly, especially Miss Pineapple.
