I have to hand it to EA. It takes a lot of time, money and effort to turn an amazing and storied franchise like SimCity into the abortion they are schlepping today. There is, quite literally, nothing about this game that I like.  I fact, SimCity 2k blows it out of the water in every respect.<br /><br />It would be wonderful if EA would go under so other developers can take this, and other franchises, and run with them.
