This game has the usual hidden object sections but also has an interesting mix of puzzles and problems to be solved. Nothing is terribly difficult so a good game for those looking for entertainment... The storyline is a bit eerie and well-done.     Nice graphics, good storyline, interesting mix of seek&find along with other puzzles. Definitely a cut above the rest although a bit short ( why are all the really good ones too short?).     In any case, if you like a bit of eeriness with your HOG, this one is a good bet.
