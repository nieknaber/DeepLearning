This is a relatively simple puzzle game, similar to Hexic, wrapped around a decent RPG system and storyline/graphics that almost reach the level of mediocre.    Oh, and it is as addictive as crack.      It's difficult to stop playing, and it's the type of game you'll go back to regularly for a long time afterward.   The puzzle game is simple, on the surface, but the designers of the game have managed to extend it to all of the game elements in a way that makes each feel fresh.  Battles avoid repetition by introducing spells, element affinities and strengths/weaknesses to each enemy.   The RPG background  of the game doles out rewards (more power / spells / etc) to give all the strategy & puzzling a purpose, even if the story elements aren't anything special.       Dollars per gaming hour - this is the best deal on XBLA and on the XBOX 360 itself.    It's a great game and worth every penny.
