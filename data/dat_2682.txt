My daughter loves this game. I have accepted they've cut a lot of things, but for stability and how this game runs. Runs light years better than the previous versions. Seems less buggy and a much easier user interface. Graphics are clean and there is still plenty to dude, regardless of the things removed. 60 bucks is too high though. Should be 39.99.
