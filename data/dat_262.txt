Pre-Ordered. Have been trying to play. When you get lucky and are able to log in and get back to your city on EAs servers, it will not work properly, Cities in the Region do not interact as they do when server are working. Constant disconnections, loosing game data. Horrible. Wait before you buy, the game makes you wait 20 minutes after 20 minutes to get in.<br /><br />One word: Disappointing
