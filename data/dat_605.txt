If you pick this game up, you won't be able to put it down. You'll become quickly addicted to completing your next mission, boarding ships, seeking out naval battles, and finding the next stash of treasure. A great installment in the AC series and, if you're new to the series, this is a fantastic jumping-off point as you'll become introduced to the Assassin/Templar war through the eyes of another newcomer, Edward Kenway.
