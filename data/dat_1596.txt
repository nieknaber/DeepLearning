I had the original Sins Of A Solar Empire.  I was still playing it occasionally so I decided to get the updated version.  At first I was disappointed because it essentially is the original game - same interface, same voices, etc.  That went away after playing it though.  The AI is much better and the 3 races split into 6 (Rebel/Loyalist versions) makes very different strategies required for each and enough new ships to make building a fleet require some thought.  Just building a huge fleet and sending it off to a planet can be dangerous.  I've lost monster fleets to one starbase.  Thinking is always required!  Small maps play very fast but I'm usually using the Huge and Vast maps.  Those games last on average 12 hours and the strategies required in the beginning are very different than what you're using at the end.  Engaging and entertaining.  A good update on a quality game.<br />Oh, the only negative - Steam is required.  I hate Steam - I wouldn't have purchased the game if I noticed that detail before I bought it.  The game description failed to note that detail. Minus 1 star for that.  Second time that happened to me so I'm on the lookout for the fineprint.  Seems like it is deliberately hidden until after the purchase.  Feels a little dishonest.
