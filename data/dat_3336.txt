This game looks great as far as graphics and the story is very well written. There's a lot of choices to make to a point that sometimes it seems overwhelming, but at the end of the day there's a path that you are suppose to follow, but it makes you feel like there's a million options, not really, maybe you'll change the reaction of a few characters, but overall we will all get the same story minus a few tweeks.<br />There's people you want to save that there's no way to save no matter what you do. That is kind of annoying.<br /><br />The controllers when it comes to close up actions are very shitty; sometimes you need to do the same scene a bunch of times not because it was difficult, but because the controllers SUCK. Don't get me wrong, the game is good, but it needs some modifications.
