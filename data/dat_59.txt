Purchased the 12 Month Xbox Live Gold digital code and a few minutes later I received an email with a code. I entered the code into my Xbox and I was ready for another year of Live. I would definitely do this again if the price was less than the typical $60. If not though, I would rather just purchase my live through the store on my Xbox as to not have to deal with checking my email and then having to enter a code. But if im saving $10 I dont mind the extra effort.
