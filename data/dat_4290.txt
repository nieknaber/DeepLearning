This is a cute game, but it takes a lot of time, because you aren't playing it in different levels.  It's an ongoing time thing with the members of a tribe.  When you aren't playing the game, it's running in the background and your villagers are still working.  When you check back the next day, something new has happened.  It's not the type of game you can just pick up, beat a few levels, and then move onto something else.  You have to check back with it regularly, otherwise your tribe may have starved or something - it's time consuming!  If you are on a computer regularly, then I'd recommend this game, but if you're looking for a quick, fun game you can play for a few minutes and then leave, it's not for you.  Cute game though!
