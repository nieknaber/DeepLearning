I waited for this game for a while as I love the Aliens series, it has chunky controls and game play.  The feature to play online against other people is absolutely horrific, not fun at all.  I rarely buy video games anymore because you can usually finish the game in about 3 days, this game was only about 3 hours to finish.  Wait a few months for it to be in the bargain bin at your local game store if you really want this game.
