Tried downloading a couple of times thinking I'd gotten a corrupted download.  No go ... on 64 bit Win 7.  It hangs up on both the installation and game startup.  Never got to the first game.  It works on my 32 bit Win 7 laptop, but my laptop isn't really geared up for game use.  Guess I got my penny's worth.  :-)
