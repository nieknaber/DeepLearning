played about 20 hours worth of the game but there are some game crushing bugs that start at random time.  Some of the bugs don't start until your later in on the game my sound didn't start cracking until I was at the second chapter.  When loading game will crash this didn't start until I was deep into chapter 10 which really pissed me off since I've already drop so many hours into the game.  If you have a USB headset get ready for some terrible sound cracking and hearing lost but you know what you can play it without sound but there are other bugs I've ran into zombies coming out from the wall and doors that when you try and break open don't open and your stuck at the same room until you restart the level.  Unless your willing to deal with the bugs don't buy the game.
