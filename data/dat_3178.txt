It's alright... but for some reason, even with all the updates that I've installed, its still crashes intermittently which is annoying considering how much they're asking for it... and I stopped playing it once I found out that most of the plugins that are absolutely necessary in Cities XL Platinum (and considering this is just an expansion of the same game) won't work with Cities XXL.  A deal breaker had I know better and waited a little longer before purchasing it....
