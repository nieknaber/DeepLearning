Multiple leaders have different tower types, and you can customize to your preferred mix. Survival mode is where you'll spend most of your time. The game gets a lot harder 20 minutes in when the bigger monsters come, and getting past an hour in survival is very tough. Steam/Multi-player is allowed you split resources, but can use 2x as many turret types which can be huge if you co-ordinate.<br /><br />Not nearly as funny/well written as Defense Grid (try that one first if you haven't) but there's a lot more strategic depth here.
