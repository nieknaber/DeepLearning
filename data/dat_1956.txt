Finally there is a MOBA style game that has everything I want.<br /><br />* RPG mechanics<br />* More game modes<br />* Customizable heroes<br /><br />I've played games like dota and lol for a long time and I always got bored with the same old 5v5 map and never changing strategies when using heroes. In prime world I am able to give my heroes new abilities and play game modes that are ven entirely pve if I dont want to do pvp.<br /><br />Put over 500 hours into this one so far and I really enjoy it.
