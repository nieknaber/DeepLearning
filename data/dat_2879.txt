This game is great to relax to with fish everywhere.  Biggest problem is putting it down.  The best part though is the ability to play with multiple players.  Just add another mouse and off you go.  By far this one is my favorite.  Other great thing about it is after you beat the 100 boards it comes with you can download ones made up by others.  It's never ending enjoyment.
