I'm sure there are already hundreds of reviews out there, so I will not waste your time be analysing this game. I will just say:<br /><br />If you consider yourself a MMORPG gamer and like the genre, go ahead and play this game.<br />If you are a Final Fantasy fan, be it the old school FF or the newer FFs, go ahead and play this game.<br />If you like pretty graphics and awesome visuals with details being paid to even the smallest character animation, do yourself a favor and play this game.<br /><br />This really is one of if not the best &#34;new&#34; Final Fantasy game in quite a long long while. Yes it might still have some hiccups and minor setbacks as of now, but given it time it will become something maybe even more than what FFXI have achieved. I have very high hopes for this game, and I can see a bright future painted ahead of us.
