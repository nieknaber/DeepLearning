Should have listened to everyone elses reviews. This doesnt work. $17 WELL spent.<br />every other game on steam works beautifully, theres nothing like spending $17 then waiting for 2 hours for it to download, to spend THREE hours trying to get it to work. And to end up with it not working. Very Dissapointed.
