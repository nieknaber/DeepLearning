The game that is installed for PC is not 64 bit compatible. You must have a 32bit OS to successfully play the game, or it will crash. Many forums online offer some kind of mysterious work around, but only if you feel comfortable clicking links to download user-created files from their personal dropbox accounts (which is probably a virus and is certainly not supported by EA). Will be pursuing potential refund with Amazon.
