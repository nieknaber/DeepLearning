I really, really, really, wanted this to get five stars. Let me be very clear about Xcom: Enemy Unknown - it is amazingly fun and addicting. The game-play is superb, the characters are excellent, the graphics look great, and the plot is engaging. I've played through four times on normal but never beaten the game. It is, at times, brutally hard, But even that is a good thing.<br /><br />So why four stars? Bugs and errors. They drove me a crazy- i'd be in combat with a team of seasoned vets and then the game crashes. Boom all gone.<br /><br />Stuff like that got really frustrating. The camera angles are a little wonky at times, too.<br /><br />Still, despite that - if you like strategy games - BUY THIS GAME. I cannot stress that enough - buy this game. It is simply amazing when it works right. It's made by the same folks that do the Civilization series so it's safe to assume that it will get both DLC and patch love pretty soon.<br /><br />Seriously, though - buy this game.
