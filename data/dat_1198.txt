Very original concept behind this game. This is an older management/simulation game that puts you in charge of your crew of space colonists as you attempt to complete the objectives given to you. You will spend the majority of your time juggling their needs, improving their relations with other colonists, and competing against the clock to gather x amount of resources in the allotted time. As far as designing your base, colonists do not react to cluttered living conditions versus organized layouts, so this game is all about functionality over aesthetics and is rather simple in that aspect. The ways in which you can better design your base aesthetically is also limited if you choose to do so, you pretty much just have plants, different colored chair areas, and the way you choose to layout the items used by colonists.<br /><br />All-in-all, it is a great game for the time period and I would recommend it. If you're more in it for designing a base though, be cautious as you may be disappointed with how limited that aspect is.
