I saw this game for the great price of $2 and decided to pick up what people say is the best game in the rollercoaster tycoon series. The game didn't disappoint. I've played both 1 and 3, but 2 appears to be the most well rounded. The only issue is that they modified the menus so it's harder to find some select things that veteran players remember like the money tab. Other than that, the game is pretty much perfect.
