This game was ridiculously lame.  I can't even detail its lameness because it's one big ball of lame.  And the ending?  So predictable it hurts.  Even more predictable than the ending of an episode of House.  Honestly, if you want to play this because you played the first, wait for it to hit the $3 bin because that's about what it's worth.
