The two extra heist maps included in this DLC are quite interesting concepts. The scenes and characters involved are especially good. All in all, they make for very fun heists that breathe some fresh air into the somewhat limited number of heists in the base game. The new heist/map included called Counterfeit is one of my most favorites and one of the most popular maps in the PAYDAY gaming community.<br /><br />The new weaponry and gear includes an AK-47, GL-40 grenade launcher, Stryk (full auto) pistol, an automated sentry gun deployable, a toolkit (helps with completing some objectives faster), and a bonus that gives your teammates extra ammo called Big Game Hunter. The AK, GL-40, and Big Game Hunter bonus are by some of the most powerful and useful customization options in the game (widely popular among veteran players). They will help you accomplish heists and achievements on advanced difficulties.<br /><br />With PAYDAY 2 near it's release date, now is a good time to brush up on your intense co-op objective based shooter gameplay. Time to don your mask and get paid!
