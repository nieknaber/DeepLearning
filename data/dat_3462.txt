What an awesome game. Not sure how people are beating it with &#60; 20 hours of gameplay. I'm not have any issues like dying, but there are a lot of side quests and this whole &#34;Grinding machine&#34; (trading three like guns of same quality for a better quality gun), is a really awesome addition.<br />  The Playable classes have really interesting skill trees and the now have speaking parts during NPC quest giving. The game still has quite a bit of comedy and plot twists (on side quests).<br />  There are bosses you can fight, restart the game and fight again, but loot drops don't change :-(. Just use the grinding machine to upgrade the loot :-).<br />  I've played borderlands since it first came out, and this version is really fun to play, and will replay it when I beat the first play through. Others might have weird negative things to say about this game, but I feel that this version is way better that Borderlands 2. I cant wait for more DLCs like BL1 and BL2 had.
