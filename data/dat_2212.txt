It was time to renew my xbox membership, and I saw through Amazon that you could buy it and get a discount off the regular price. I bought it and clicked on the online game code, which got emailed to me instantly. I was able to redeem easily and quickly BUT I did not get the discount. Essentially I bought it at the same price I could have bought it through my xbox auto-renewal program. So plan ahead if you want to buy this and get a discount off your year-long membership by buying the card that will be mailed to you.
