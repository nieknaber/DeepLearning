Hellas 2 is a great game for people who love Mahjong or matching games.  The puzzles at the end of each section are moderately challenging because they hide items behind other items you must complete finding components for.  This game was a little more challenging than Hellas 3 but Hellas 3 provides you with more playing time to complete building your city.
