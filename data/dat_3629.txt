I've been trying to play this game since I've purchased it and haven't been able to get it to work for longer than 10 minutes. I literally have to save the game obsessively due to insanely frequent crashes. Even after the game update, the game still crashes ALL THE TIME and I mean ALL THE TIME!!! I've clocked it and I usually get about 8 minutes of running time prior to a crash. It's worth the extra wait to just order the game through the mail. At least that way it will work!
