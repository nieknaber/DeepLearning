I *loved* Royal Envoy and enjoyed Gardenscapes so I thought I would give this one a try. I winded up playing it all the way through and while it was entertaining, it was nowhere as fun as the other games.<br /><br />The story line was kind of silly. It didn't follow the games (at least, it didn't for me.) You saved the farm and stopped them from building the mall well before the end. The characters kind of just sit around for a bit and the parents call and say they will pick you up \\"soon.\\".<br /><br />The \\"simulation\\" and Hidden Objects part were very minor compared to the match 3 parts which I guess is not necessarily a bad thing if match 3 are your favorite types of games. There are three farms that you can rebuild but I was uninterested in going further once I completed the first ones. The other farms looked like exact replicas of the first one with no added bonuses.
