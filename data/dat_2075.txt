Can anyone help me get Origin, EA's client to work? &#34;Origin Login Unavailable&#34;<br /><br />I already checked youtube, and forums. Tried compatibility, added Origin to exclusion on windows firewall and Microsoft Essentials Anti-virus.<br /><br />If this issue can't be resolved I demand a refund from amazon and suggest they stop selling for EA
