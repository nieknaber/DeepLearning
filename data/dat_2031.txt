Lots of the same stuff from Morrowind (you can cast two different spells with both of your hands, you can pick up almost anything in the world, and you can take peoples' clothing from them after you kill them), but they got rid of a lot of the bad from it (you now actually have a storyline, not just a &#34;screw it, find it yourself&#34; kind of path, and there's an actual story that most people will care about).<br /><br />It can be confusing (the skills can take a bit of time to understand completely), but overall it is a lot of fun. Try it on your computer, it will more than likely work like a charm. I was expecting it to run horribly, and be laggy, but it was almost like butter.
