I think my favorite variety is Ticket to Ride: Switzerland. The ability to realistically complete a large number of route cards in one game is a big draw compared to the other varieties. They are all basically fun and the different bonus conditions at the end of game play adds some variety.<br /><br />I don't love Steam as a DRM but it has not caused any major issues.
