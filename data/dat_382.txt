I have played or demoed all for the dream day games.  This one is the best.  The story behind it is so very sweet and touching.  The use of real letters and pictures from the couple is a wonderful idea.  The love story is also very touching you want to finish the puzzles to see how the couple's relationship grew and blossomed.      If you are a fan of hidden object games this is a nice change from the dark gloomy ones.  Finding the murder can be fun, but it is nice to have a bright sunny game every once in a while too.
