My main game of choice is first person shooters, well this is a THIRD person shooter which I hate to start with BUT other then that the ratings above are good as it is just plain STUPID and boring to be honest. I got to one place where you have to kill these people with pretty much nothing and they have guns. Guess how many times I died? INSANE and I just flat forgot the game exists. Any how thankfully I didn't pay much for it so I can toss it in the trashcan where it truly belongs.
