this is the third download game i bought recently.  My mistake was making it the last of the three.  I it a very good deal in terms of bang for buck, however i found the gameplay a little boring when compared to 4 Elements and Rainforest Adventure.  Some thoughts<br /><br />- lotsa play time - waay more that the other 2<br />- I usually like the music score that come with games, couldn't stand the music of JQ III music (II was very good)<br />- no power-ups<br />- I bought Rainforest and 4 Elements... both had very nice graphics but also a nice flow and cool power-ups and the music (esp 4 elements was a joy)
