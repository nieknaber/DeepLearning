Because of the price ($0.99) I decided to buy it, but I was not able to download it to my computer. After several attemps I quit and call the 800 numbers for assistance  and was advised to download the game for the second time which I did and was able to play the game. I noticed what I got is All-in-one Mahjong 2 (download) and was charged again of ($0.99). Later, my computer became weird and slow while surfing. The following day my computer freezed and the only thing to do is press button to tunn it off. The only solution that helps me regain the used of my computer is to do the system restore which take about an hour. When it's done the downloaded game that I purchased twiced is no longer there. This game harm my computer don&#34;t be fool by the price be carefull in buying downloaded games.
