Can't play it longer than 20 minutes without it crashing my entire operating system, and because the tutorial has no save points, I'm stuck doing the tutorial...repeatedly. Yes, I've updated all the relevant drivers and I'm right in between minimum and recommended requirements; I have no trouble playing WoW, City of Heroes/Villains, Guild Wars, or even Final Fantasy XIV. It looks like a fun game, but it's kinda lame to spend $50 on a game that just plain won't work. Hopefully  they'll patch it sufficiently in the next month or two to make it playable.
