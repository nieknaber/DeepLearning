I thought I would take a risk and try to run it with Windows 7 in Compatability mode, using Windows XP Service Pack 2 settings. It does not work. It states the platforms, and it is my fault for not heading the obvious. But, I thought I would put this on here incase anyone else had the same idea. I never got to see the game, but the music sounds good. LOL. I gave it 4 stars, because I have played Rollercoaster Tycoon 2, and it was a good game. I would expect this to be, as well.
