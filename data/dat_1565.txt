What can I say, the season pass for Borderlands 2  provides plenty of value, especially for the price which I had the luck on get it. The present released DLC can keep you entertain for countless hours, but that's not it! In fact there are still a few more DLC packs to come this year! So all in al it was a pretty awesome deal! Thx amazon!
