This is my first MMO and I think I picked a good one to start at, but I do not think MMO's are for me. After lvl. 30 I started to lose interest. Coincidentally that is when it starts to become more fun...or at least that is what I am told. From the standpoint of the quality of the game, I believe it to be very well made.
