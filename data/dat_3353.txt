I got this free download when I pre-ordered Far Cry 3. The game worked fine once I got it running, but it took a little bit to get moving. First, you'll see in the description it says 32 bit OS only, that means 32 Bit OS Only. It runs on a 64 bit computer but you can't install it. I had to install it onto my old computer and copy the files over to my newer 64 bit computer. After wards I needed to get the .dll files for the program to let itself run.<br />Those were all of the negatives, here are the positives.<br />The game is amazing. While it is relatively old now, it is quite possibly the best shooter I have ever played. Aside from characters having cheesy lines and moving oddly in cut scenes, the game play is solid. Also, the great thing about this game is that it gets insanely difficult, even on the easiest setting. Don't expect a breeze of a game. Expect to spend time actually figuring out enemy weaknesses and learning how to shoot a gun. Although I guarantee you'll get stressed out about certain parts of this game, the 10 hour or so ride is great. Beating it is the biggest payoff I ever felt in completing a game. I'm not going to lie, I feel like a pro for beating this.... on the easy setting...<br />4 stars only just because of setting up the game. If you have a 32 Bit OS read my review as a 5 star,
