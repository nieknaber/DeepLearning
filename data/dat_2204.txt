Great looking, great playing, great story. It couldn't get much better at all!<br /><br />I like Ezio a lot more in this game than in the others. He seems a bit more mature which certainly helps his already fantastic character.<br /><br />The combat is just as fluent as the rest of the series, but seems to go just a bit slow in some places (game play wise).
