I've been a long time fan of SimCity. I have a busy schedule as I travel a lot for my work so I was thinking building a city as I go from place to place would pass some of the time.<br /><br />Little did I know that it's impossible to have a continuous experience without a steady internet connection. Now the airports and hotels I stop by have WiFi but it is no where near the speed or reliability you need to play this game!<br /><br />Every now and then when I'd get a streak of 30min-1hour my connection drops and I lose the last 40% of work I did on my city; rolling back to a random save point that I have no control over.<br /><br />I had to return this game because I couldn't even play it. I had a decent experience - gameplay was smooth although rigid. Again, my biggest issue was the fact that I had NO control on my experience.<br /><br />I would consider buying it again when it's &#60;$20 or when they make an offline mode.
