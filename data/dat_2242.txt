I was a bit paranoid on this download because I had never purchased from amazon. I wanted the game, but I had missed the Steam sale where the price was knocked down to $40. I got on amazon and saw that the sale was still up. I made sure I was getting a good deal and purchased. Was an easy transfer to steam and fast download! Love the game so far!
