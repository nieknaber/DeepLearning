For $49.99 you are getting a ton of content. Five full-fledged expansion packs adding new maps, weapons, vehicles, and more to the game. Two week early access to said expansions. Twelve Gold Battlepacks (you get three right away, the rest you get over time). Plus tons of other weekly bonus content and Premium exclusive events. This is a one-time fee, so you don't have to renew Premium like a subscription. Premium offers so much more to the Battlefield 4 experience I cannot even list how much content is included. I give DICE and EA huge props for offering true &#34;Expansion Packs&#34; to the game, most other games give away little map packs with no new content besides maps for the same price DICE and EA are charging for an expansion pack. Best of all you save money with Premium compared to if you were to buy each expansion individually, plus if you buy the expansions individually you don't get all of the perks and content associated with Premium. If you have Battlefield 4 or plan on getting Battlefield 4, be sure to get Premium as well, you will not be disappointed.
