One of the best FPS since Far Cry - and what a deal! $9.99 for three games. The game puts you in buildings that have many simuliar rooms, hallways, warehouses, etc. The trick is to remember where you've been - but then you don't want this to be too easy - right? This game is what you'd expect more expensive games to be - very entertaining. If you're a FPS fan, this game will satisfy.
