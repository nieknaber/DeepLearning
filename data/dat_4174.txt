I loved Fallout 3, and dedicated 170 hours to the GOTY edition. I was hoping for more of the same from FNV and it pretty much delivered. While much is the same there have been some changes. The graphics have apparently been improved, although I didn’t really notice any difference (it looks a bit creaky by today’s standards, but is better than some from the same period). But the main changes relate to gameplay. F3 managed a perfect balance between RPG and shooter. For me, FNV leans a little too far in favour of the role-playing elements. There’s less combat and what combat there is isn’t quite as much fun as it was in F3. Also the main story is less engaging, with emphasis placed on the alliances you forge with the various factions along the way. I enjoyed this aspect of the game but would’ve liked more meat on the main storyline. That having been said all the elements that made F3 so good are still here. The Mohave Desert is another huge open world waiting to be explored. There are numerous quests to be enjoyed, and all the immersive qualities are still there.<br /><br />A quick note about bugs: F3 was a bit buggy but FNV takes the cake on this score. In the 120 hours I spent playing the game it must have crashed 50 times or more. Save games fail to load as do maps on occasion. I even had a couple of NPCs go missing, one of which was a quest-giver (a side quest luckily). So be forewarned: it can be frustrating at times.
