Single player for this one is a bit stale. Don't get me wrong, game is gorgeous! The vistas and set pieces, amazing! Now, I only finished 3 chapters in the campaign, and there is maybe a case that it will get better later.<br /><br />On the other hand, multiplayer is amazing. It's a lot faster then previous KZ games. The maps are good and also gorgeous. The menus are a bit overwhelming at start, but once you get the hang of it it really is organized good.<br /><br />If you want to try the OTHER big shooter, get this game.<br />Amazon code delivery was excellent. Fast, not a single problem.
