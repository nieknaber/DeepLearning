I played this game on a Windows 7 PC, which worked fine.  The game was amazing!  You start at a Japanese inn (Ryokan), and everything is happening in Kyoto.  Eventually you do Nonogram puzzles, Sudoku, Renograms, and make cute animal bento boxes.  Nancy will have to go to a \\"Pachinko Parlor\\", which is kind of like an arcade to win prizes.  You will also have to solve a mystery, which involves a lot of paranormal activity, and maybe you will be scared after awhile.  I assure you in the end you will have a sigh of relief.
