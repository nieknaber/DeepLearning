The best review I can give is to say this. Remember how war movies use to be? Then Saving Private Ryan came out and changed the way we see war cinematically. This game does just that. War is awful, and while games may try to glorify it, no one wins in war. This game executes that perfectly. I have yet to finish it, but the story and the consequences for the choices you have to make in this game are as close to the battle field as any of us will hopefully ever have to see. I hope this game goes on an on for another month, and if DLC comes out, I will happily get that too. Multiplayer I can't say anything as I haven't played it.
