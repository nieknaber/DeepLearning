Anarchy Studios has recently gotten its laurels from another series of games they created, the 'Redrum' series of hidden object games, which were very straight-forward. However, the 'Coffee Rush' series while it does have its playability and fun factor can sometimes leave the gamer ableit scratching his head every now and again.     I have played a great deal of Match-3 titles, such as 'Cursed House'. 'Puzzle Quest' and Puzzle Quest 2'. I have even played up the end 'Pizza Chef 2', which was another puzzle game though different in concept.     The mechanics of 'Coffee Rush' have been intermingled with that of a time management style format, with serving customers the coffee of their choice. As you play and earn tokens, you gain more coffee receipes that will bring you larger revenues that you can buy in the store, as well as treats to keep customers from walking out. Very simple and to-the-point. Here are some of the things that are not straight to the point. To start, the Match-Three can be somewhat frustrating. I have played numerous levels where you have to literally hunt for what you need and there is a good chance that you may not find what you need in that moment. Therefore, you end up making a lot of matches of what you may not need. Secondly, the patience level of your customers is a little difficult to work with. You can buy power-ups in the store, but they only give you a certain amount at any given time. Once you run out, if your customer is in a bad state and about to walk out, you will have to spend even MORE time looking for power-up combinations within the grid.      'Coffee Rush', by far, is not a bad game but also not a great game. It had a lot of potential and the first incarnation needed some more spit-and-polish before Anarchy Studios released it. But, if you want a good time-waster while waiting for something or someone, this will be very good for at least doing that.
