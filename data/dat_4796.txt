It is far grittier than previous Tomb Raider games (hence the M rating). That said, I'm enjoying the game a lot. What keeps it from four stars is that it's more of a shooter than I expected. With enemies that hurl molitovs (and, last night, dynamite), I find that I'm randomly leaping in different directions to avoid being killed, which is my least favorite aspect of any of the Tomb Raider games.<br /><br />A second pet peeve is the amount of damage the protagonist takes. While it humanizes the character, over the course of the game, it exceeds what one could continue to endure. By going from video game avatar to a more realistic model, immersion is a bit difficult when she is able to stomach such injuries and press forward.<br /><br />Anyway, if you like the genre, this one is very strong and well worth the investment.
