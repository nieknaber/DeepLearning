Ever wondered if you could be the next Pep Guardiola and take a team from the English 5th division and turn them into the next Barca? Well with the right coaches, training, and a bit of transfer wizardry, this game allows you to attempt just that!  Basic navigation and game play is pretty straight forward but after playing the game now for a couple of months I'm still learning new tips and tricks that continue to make my managerial experience exciting!  I couldnt recommend this game more highly to any football manager wanna-be who at some point has said, I could run the club better than him!
