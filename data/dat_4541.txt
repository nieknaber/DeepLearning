You can find this as a download or a disc, by searching \\"Liong\\" here on amazon. This Liong page says its an unavailable download, but it IS available through amazon as download and as a game disc. I own it, and want to purchase another to give to someone else. It's fantastic. Deep rich bright colors and fine graphic images quality. Very good hidden object, very good mahjong matching, \\"bonus\\" matching, bingo, tangram type mix in between the mahjong and hidden object (you can do or skip the \\"bonus\\" games). The mahjong tiles can be a choice of pictorial, character or mixed; the difficulty overall can be harder and timed or not. I don't find the score after each minigame to be irritating at all and its not there long; and you choose to continue and it loads the next game segment. Runs smoothly. Just beautiful graphics. The mahjong is a little different than traditional mahjong matching in that you match the certain tiles that are indicated to match, and also you wait for little pearls to be revealed and click them to add them to your stash of pearls. There are also pearls to gather amid the hidden object games, besides the hidden objects. The music is decent. Overall this is a great stress-reliever and it's fun to play and replay.
