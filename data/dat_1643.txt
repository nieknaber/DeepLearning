I thought it would be great to leave the game console and get back to the PC, old-school style. Yikes. Create a login to EA-whatever...create a login to Origin-whatever...etc., etc. When I finally got to gameplay, I had no mouse pointer. Then found absolutely no online support to get a driver, anything. Such arrogance! That it would automatically work across all issues such that they have no need for such trivialities as product support! Silly gamers! OF COURSE IT WILL WORK, YOU JUST SCREWED UP THE INSTALL. I grew tired of that crap in the 90's.
