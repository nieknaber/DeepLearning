I was loving this game.  Got pretty far, I was a level 20.  But then at the beginning of the level Carn Dum, the game crashed.  I would reload, and the game still crashed.  Eventually I gave up, and started the game completely over.  I just got to Carn Dum again, and the game crashed again.  Unacceptable.
