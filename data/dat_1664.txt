This made this game so statistics intense that they forgot about letting into the game to play.  But boy, is this loaded with stats.  You can play any game that you wish or play your own league schedule or follow the present league schedule and see how close (or far away) you can get.  My only problem is the interface, not the game, but it may only be that I am stupid....in may case that is a REAL position to take...lol, hell, at this price buy it and figure it out.
