This item gives you a 12-character code you type in at the PSN for $20.00 to use on the store.  There are two major pros to using these codes over your own credit card:    > As many people know, PSN was hacked a few months ago, and it's possible that credit card information was compromised.  This already is a great reason to get this item.  > If you buy items on the PSN using your credit card, you have to pay sales tax for the state you live in.  However, if you use these codes, there is no sales tax.  There will be sales tax for buying this item from amazon in certain states, but you would have been hit with that tax anyway had you purchased directly from PSN.  The majority of people living in the US will save money by not paying sales tax.    There's one con:    > These cards are only sold in 10, 20, or 50 dollar increments, so if you have unused money you're basically giving money to Sony and Amazon.  Fortunately, unused money in your PSN has no expiration date.     If there's something you want to get on PSN and don't trust Sony with your credit card information (for good reason), these codes are a great alternative.  You can also easily give these codes to other people as a gift, say.
