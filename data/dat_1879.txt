Controversial game of its time, I own the first and thought I would try out the &#34;sequel&#34;. I enjoy the story, over the top violence, and the dialogue. However, the controls were a bit clunky, being that it was made for motion detected platforms/pc. Overall, I felt satisfied. Still prefer the first.
