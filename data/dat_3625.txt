Didn't pay a cent for it, and the time I have played it I can say there is fun to be had here. It definitely feels really old school because it is old school (nothing wrong with old school!). It's definitely fun, if you can get it for free that's always a positive. Otherwise I'm not sure if I would shell out 5 dollars for this unless you've played it before or have been really interested in buying it for awhile.
