I've played many simulation games and was really looking forward to this one.  Regrettably, this game is lacking in all areas.  It took a long time to figure out what to do in this game and how to start making money.  Even still, I found myself spending my time fast forwarding the game to get the day done with.  There was nothing to fill the space of your 'day to day' time in game.  If you can figure out how to play this game, you will soon find yourself bored and annoyed that you even bothered to learn.  I feel like the company put time and effort into a game that had the potential to be great.  Don't bother buying this game, you'll just be frustrated.
