Your team mates in single player get stuck. Not as much style. And the graphics looked bad at first, but they can be improved.<br /><br />In the file BaseEngine.ini, I turned on multi path lighting, shader model 3, and turned off static lighting. You may have to turn resolution and anti aliasing down a little for speed - they don't matter as much as lighting.<br /><br />I was very disappointed at first, but after the graphic adjustments, the only problem is the block headed team mates. Try running into them if they get stuck.
