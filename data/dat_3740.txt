I love time management games. However, there are so many bland ones out there that are just boring and repetitive. This is not one of those games.    Your character is a young lady who wants to prove to her grandma she has what it takes to make it in the ice cream biz. Its starts off easy: customers come in slowly and have lots of patience while they wait for you to fix them an ice cream cone. As the levels progress customers come in at a faster pace and lose patience faster. There really are a wide variety of characters as the levels progress and each has their own unique temperament. Customer demands also change as the game gets harder. Their ice cream orders will become more complex (more scoops and different toppings). They may not even want ice cream at all and order a milk shake or frozen yogurt instead.     As you make money you can buy new machines and upgrade the ones you already own to make your shop run more efficiently. You can buy faster ice cream machines, a frozen yogurt machine, sneakers so your character moves quicker etc.     This game is very similar to Cake Mania. However, I found this game to be more fun because your character had more interesting things to do in her shop. Plus its just so cute and wacky!
