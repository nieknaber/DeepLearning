If you want to know more about the games I'd suggest you read about them individually on someone elses review. I just wanted to let gamers know that it was simple to unlock thru Steam.<br />Amazon quickly gives you the code to download for Steam and in an hour (depending on your connection speed of course) your able to play any three.<br />Whatever you do, remember to put ON the PhysX option in the settings. I didn't want to play the first game but then I saw it with PhysX turned on and it felt like a new experience.<br />For Arkham City it crashes the game... sort of. I have PhysX on Normal and it looks good. Once I set it to High my game would just crash after 5 seconds. It's a known problem and unfortunately no real fixes, Just suggestions.<br />For Origins it makes a very nice difference. Just looking at the snow after a fight shows how great PhysX is.<br />I don't know why X isn't in more games but it should be.<br />Go to Youtube and search PhysX if you've never seen it before.<br />The games are still fun to play. Easy to install. Looks better than consoles. Full controller support.<br />As another reviewer put it, the price of this bundle is the price of a season pass.
