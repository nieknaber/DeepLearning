I bought this thinking it was a flight simulator.  After installing it, the only things installed on my computer were documents.  There is no manual or anything to explain what to expect.  There is nothing to explain what is required to use this strange software.  I have been a software engineer for many years.  I have written many installations for various software.  I have a lot of experience in this field.  I would not recommend this product, whatever it is.  By the way, you can't return it for credit or refund.
