This does work on Windows 7/Vista. Download was fine and the game works. If you want to use billboards in the game (and you don't need or have too), you have to fix the directory if you have Windows 7/Vista. That is the only issue and that is only because the game itself was made prior to windows vista coming out. You can search the internet for instructions on how to do that. Otherwise, it works fine!
