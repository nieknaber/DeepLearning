This game was a big hype and was told that this game was the best but after playing it; since I bought digital download, I was disappointed. The game not only has some twitches when moving the character, camera sensitivity's too High, the lighting hurts my eyes...I don't know what else to day. It was ok for a game but won't be planning on getting this again. No hard feelings.
