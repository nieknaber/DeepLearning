Having now taken ten characters through the expansion, I can give you a thorough review. The worlds are well thought out and pleasing to the eye.  How ever despite taking 10 toons through both planets , I was unable to complete all the missions in full as there were to many bugs. For the first 5 toons there was serious ability delay on both Rishi and Yavin 4 making melee characters almost impossible to play. The last 5 toons only suffered severe ability delay on yavin 4 , Rishi was playable but still laggy. The final battle with Revan was bugged on Yavin 4 so had to do this on average 4 times before completing it. Due to the lag/ability delay I feel short changed by this expansion. Its fair to say my enjoyment post release of the Revan Expansion has gone down. I endured the lagginess and poor enjoyment rate just to get through it. To me the expansion is not fit for purpose as to my mind it should have been an enjoyable experience not a frustrating one. Any changes that come to the expansion this late on will not benefit me or most of the SWTOR community.I run Ivy bridge 3770k cpu and gtx 680 gpu on a Sabertooth motherboard my connection is good. This is not just me suffering here, the whole of the SWTOR forums are awash with complaints. So much so SWTOR have been forced to make a statement apologizing and stating their plans to put it right.
