I downloaded this game as soon as it became available and it has been loads of fun. everything i was hoping for and more. the new updated vampires are not THAT much different (which is good) the zombies are... interesting the werewolves are really fun i havent played with any withces yet but so far the pixies are my favorite. they are unique to sims like nothing i can remember the franchise doing before. i love how this game reminds me of making magic (because lets face it that was the best expansion in sims 1) the items the clothing the hairs all stick to the theme unlike some expansions before. i rate this game 5 stars out of 5 because its what ive been wanting for sims 3 for a very long time. :D
