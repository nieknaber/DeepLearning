I think everyone would agree that the simcity franchise is so enjoyable to play, and that doesn't exclude Simcity 5. BUT..<br /><br />Although EA has increased the number of servers and you can easily log in and play, this didn't put an end for disappointments! There will never be an end.<br /><br />Consider this, if you choose to play on Oceanic 1 server let's say, you'll have to stick to that server if you wish to keep developing your same city. Changing the server will force you to start from scratch! So this whole thing about servers is a s***ty lie. Your city isn't synchronized on all servers.<br /><br />So, there is a big chance for instance to be playing on one server and it gets full (or is put under maintenance) while all other servers have empty slots. In this case, you'll be disconnected from the game and forced to wait until there are empty slots available in order to continue building your city.<br /><br />Will all the disappointments caused by the DRM & lack of synchronization between servers, you'll soon be fed up with all this s*** and lose interest in the game.<br /><br />Hence, DON'T BUY THIS GAME !<br /><br />*** *UPDATE 4/March/2013 ****<br /><br />Yesterday I contacted Amazon by email to express my disappoint regarding my purchase, and the customer support were kind enough to refund my money even though it's been almost a month since I bought the game. Thank God I didn't purchase it from EA !! Their customer support lacks basic commonsense.<br /><br />So, 5 stars to Amazon, 1 star to EA !!!
