If you buy this game for the PC don't expect the gameplay to be anything like the previous titles.<br /><br />I gave it two stars because the graphics were awesome, but only for that.<br /><br />There's no planning phase, so you have no ability to equip appropriately for the mission.<br /><br />There's no option for skipping the interminably looooooooooooong cut scenes so every time you go back to retry the level, you get to sit through &#34;Hitman: Absolution, The Five Minute Mini-Movie&#34;  all over again.  And again.  And again.  And again...<br />Do yourself a favor.  Just turn up the volume, and then go get yourself a snack in the kitchen, watch some tv and listen from the next room for when the cut-scene ends.  Otherwise you're going to put a hammer through the screen and we don't want that.<br /><br />Everything is canned.  You can acquire new weapons through the levels but, with no planning phase, you can't go back later try to replay the level with different gear.  The &#34;Contracts&#34; portion is online only and you can only select you initial outfit and primary weapon, but that's all.  So basically, all of the replay value that made Hitman: Blood Money so much fun (and that I expected again)?  Gone.<br /><br />It's like somebody sucked all the flavor out of my lollipop, wrapped it in a pretty, glossy new wrapper and said, &#34;Here. Enjoy.&#34;<br /><br />If I'd known then what I know now, I would have waited awhile and maybe purchased this title at a discount.
