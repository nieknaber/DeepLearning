I wanted to like this game. I expected to like this game. I did like this game - for the first two hours I played it - and then it crashed.     I checked the computer requirements. My computer more than meet them. \\"Well,\\" I thought. \\"These things happen sometimes.\\"    I tried it again. Two hours into the game, at about the same level of game build up; twenty citizens, hiring a sheriff, etc. - it crashed again.    This time though I had been saving often. I rebooted my machine, restarted the game and tried to reload my saved game - nothing! It just hung there for fifteen minutes. Finally I had to go into Task Manager and cancel the program.    I want my money back.    UPDATE: After five days, I finally got an answer from Sandlot the publisher of the game. I had a driver that needed updating. After that was fixed, the game played beautifully UNTIL I HIT THE 45 CITIZEN CAP!!! That took about three hours of game play.    Another major criticism of this game is the need to micro-manage everything. You have to constantly run around repairing everything and replanting trees. How much smoother game play would have been if I could have assigned a citizen to these chores.    Anyway, for the slow support (five day response time), 45 citizen cap, and forced micro-management I still give the game one star.
