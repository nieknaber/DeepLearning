Great game! I use to play this years ago but my pc disk was lost during a move. Seeing the new simcity5 coming out in 2013 I was feeling nostalgic for simcity4 and decided to buy the download. I hesitated a bit because I wasn't sure if it'll work on my new laptop that runs windows 7 64bit I was like what the hell its only 15bucks, downloaded in less that 30 minutes and ran perfectly! you do have to make a few adjustments so it'll fill a widescreen, since the comps back then weren't widescreen like they are now. So what you do is you left click the simcity4 desktop icon and go to properties and type in the target after the \\"\\" type this: -f -CustomResolution:enabled -r1366x768x32 and it'll fill your widescreen beautifully! it runs alittle sluggish but its no different than the old pc's. Very happy :)
