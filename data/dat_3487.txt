PROS:<br />Graphics up to date blah bla<br />Interactive environment weather and daylight system.<br />Multiple vehicles<br />Large map loads dynamically.<br />Lots of missions<br /><br />CONS:<br />You have to get missions your self. You go to a one of multiple points on the map to get a mission that makes game extremely boring and time consuming.<br />Drive back and forth thru same places again and again to get missions that are all similar.<br />You explore places before you get to have a mission to be there, so when you get a mission to get there, you already know the area and there is nothing new.<br />1 large map, no levels. Its just one jungle map that just makes you sick after a while.
