I just got the download, and it went smoothly. I have a Macbook Pro (2012), and from what I've been playing it seems functional. I managed to play for about an hour, before I had to exit and I didn't experience any problems. It wasn't like when I got Pets, which was unplayable for months.<br /><br />I'm giving this a tentative 4 stars, as I like what's been offered in this game. I love the addition of weather, I think it's fun and so great. I love the festivals and basically, I think it's a solid addition. Providing it can get patched so everyone else can enjoy it.<br /><br />**I did play without custom content, so I'm going to try it with and see what happens. I also always keep my graphics settings at mid level or lower, so that might also be a factor. I also saved every ten to fifteen minutes, as well.
