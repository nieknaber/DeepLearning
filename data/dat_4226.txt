So my grandfather was a city planner back in the day. When I told him about the concept of Sim City he got really excited, but didn't think he could handle it. He wasn't really tech savvy, but I told him I would help him figure it out. Well, needles to say, after about 2 hours of playing this game, he told me, and I quote \\"It's crap like this that makes me wish I would have died in the war\\".
