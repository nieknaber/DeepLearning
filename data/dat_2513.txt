The game mechanics and UI are revamped and really solid. I have been playing Total war games since the first medieval. I was really upset at ETW buggy release. But I believe CA has redeemed themselves with S2 ROS and FOS. If you can get this game on sale it's a great value. I got mine for under $15 during the thanksgiving sale. Can't wait for Rome 2. I have Darthmod installed to make the game a little more difficult and enjoyable.
