This game is amazing!  I'm so glad I preordered it from Amazon.  This game looks and plays like nothing I've ever seen before.  I thought Skyrim with mods was beautiful; Tomb Raider tops it!  AAA+ title and a must buy for anyone that considers themselves to be a gamer.  Did everyone see the laundry list of PC exclusive additions to the game engine?  Amazing!  And the frame rate hovers around 60 fps the entire time!  You're doing yourself a disservice if you skip 2013's game of the year so far.  Thank you Square Enix and Crystal Dynamics.  And Lara Croft's hair is beautiful!  Very, very good first impression playing this game.  And in 3D the game looks even more special and runs butter smooth if you have the horsepower to push.<br /><br />Sapphire 7950<br />AMD FX-8120
