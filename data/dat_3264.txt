For $10 Punisher No Mercy is a deal I like playing it from time to time. You just have pretty simple objectives just rack up a kill count & I think the gore is good graphics are decent comic book cut scenes are cool. Story is basic too Jigsaw is importing a drug you need to stop it & find Jigsaw. So I think it's a decent game I haven't gone online a lot though. The game can be beaten in like less than an hour & I think if your looking for a game to play to pass the time I think you should get it.
