As an RPG it is about average.  It could never stand up to the likes of Elder Scrolls, or Fallout et.al. as an RPG adventure.  It is somewhat short in duration, and I don't see a lot of replay value.  The good news is, it has the South Park humor that you are looking for.  Eric Cartman is as usual in good form for insulting everyone so it is not for the young, only the young at heart.  But then again, Cartman's ability to slander everyone is one of the main reasons you are getting this game right?  And it has been implemented with the right design, so it does indeed look and feel like a natural extension of the South Park universe so you feel like you are directing a new episode; and this is maybe the second reason for getting the game.<br /><br />So it is really only for South Park fans, not someone who likes great RPG games.
