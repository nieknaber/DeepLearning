Its true what has been said, entirely too many enemies to be believable, but still a great game. Awesome graphics, physics, gameplay, and extremely challenging at many parts, if you have the difficulty high enough. I thought it was just about the right length, and you don't have to play the game through multiple times to see all 3 endings. Grab it if you have the chance.<br /><br />*Steam client DRM required.
