Just one more turn.... just one more turn..... just one more turn.... Crap it's 3am and I have to be up for work at 7am. Beware of the time of day when you start playing this game. It can get out of hand pretty quick haha. Great strategy and always a fun series to play. Some didn't like this as much as Civ IV; but I prefer this one. The city-states idea is a very fun wrinkle.
