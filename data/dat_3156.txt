That sums it up. The game is great (I only do the solo campaigns) but I can't believe it's not in 3D for the PC. The previous BF games were in 3D so I assumed all new games would be in 3D. I don't think I would have bought it had I known I couldn't play it in 3D. I've read, \\"maybe\\" it will be modified to 3D but I've already gone through the campaign twice. Disappointing....<br /><br />UPDATE 1/14/2014  I can finally play this in 3D after getting an update to my Tridef software. So maybe the problem wasn't with the game. But...it would be nice if they listed somewhere in the game if it is 3D capable. I assumed it was but still can't find any text confirming that fact. Now it's maybe at least 4 stars. I'm starting the Campaign over in 3D this time and so far it looks great!
