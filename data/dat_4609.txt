The game is a neat concept, progressing the past iterations of simcity graphics wise, but it fails to improve them content wise. The game lacks variety, and small city sizes limit creativity. By the time your city is profitable enough to begin specialization, you find that there is no more room to place anything, and you must resort to deleting something to make room. The game also experiences occasional crashes for me, including a few city roll backs, which can be very frustrating. If the city limits were increased, this game would be immensely more entertaining.
