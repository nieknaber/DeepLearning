If you would throw away all the comparisons with Simcity 3000 or Simcity 4 and evaluate this as a standalone game, it isn't too bad. I just have a few issues with this:<br /><br />1) If EA's servers can't handle the amount of players online at one time, please find another DRM method to fight piracy.<br />2) This game is already rather expensive by itself. Why charge more for add-ons to and piss people off? It's hard to fork out money to buy some pixels.<br />3) PLEASE INCREASE THE LAND SIZE OR MAKE IT VARIABLE!!!!!
