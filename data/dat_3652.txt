This game is absolute garbage. It's very poorly designed, idiotically boring as hell, and doesn't run very well on a machine that can run Skyrim at very high settings like butter. The code must be a stinking cesspool. I don't even know what to say about this -- don't buy it, not even for 5 bucks, unless you're hardcore degenerate that starts drinking cheap Vodka at 7 a.m. on a good day. Get any other zombie game -- in fact, almost any game is better than this. I wish there were a return policy on digital game downloads as this is total crap.
