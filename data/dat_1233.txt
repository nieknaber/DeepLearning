In any other circumstance if a company sells you a broken product you would expect that they would refund you the money specially when you are talking abou a company as large as EA. I dont purchase too many video games but splurged on this one as I have too many memories playing sim city as a child. I was patient for a month thinking they would fix the issues with the server but when they released the stupid Nissan Leaf when the actual game is dysfunctional upset me a lot. They also offerred the Game on a discount on Amazon as they were getting such terrible reviews so I feel screwed every way for purchasing this game. I asked the company for my money back and they refused. I am so upset with EA and Maxis, I have promised myself to never purchase another EA game even if that Game has an answer to \\"the universe, life and everything\\".<br /><br />I have asked my credit company to refund my money claiming that I am a victim of Fraud, the funny thing was the agent knew about the issue and said that normally they dont issue claims when it comes to software and games but they are aware about the simcity crisis and he filed a claim for me. He advised me to uninstall my game so I did and am waiting for my claim. I am so upset that I will even close my credit card account if they fail to protect me in this instance.<br /><br />I would suggest everyone file a claim with your credit card company to get a refund, this would end up costing the devils at EA more in time and money.
