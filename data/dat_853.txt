Even though the game claims to support Windows 7, I'm glad I chose the free trial first.  When attempting to launch, I got a \\"sys3d select display mode error\\" and then a \\"sys3de init drive error\\".  I am running a 6 month old high-end machine, so hardware is not the issue.<br /><br />The full version *might* be Windows 7 compatible, but there's no way to tell from the free trial, since I am not going to pay money for a game that doesn't work.
