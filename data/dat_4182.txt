Decently entertaining game, gets a little repetitive though.  I have enjoyed playing this game, and love it's artistic style more than anything else.  The gameplay is smooth, combat is interesting.  The different types of characters and play styles and a good re-playability to the game, if you can handle the story that many times.<br />I find some of the questing to be somewhat tedious, and chasing around doing 'kill this many' quests kind of annoying.  Other types, such as switching on particular switches to enable pump mechanisms are entertaining.<br />Overall it's a great game, with good re-playability, but it's still not something I'm missing when not playing it.
