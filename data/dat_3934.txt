Please stick with 2k14 if you already have it. I bought this one for PC and they have over tuned the reversal system to such an extent that now it its next to impossible to do reversals. Also, the port from console to PC is not done well. The game looks sluggish while performing moves or just doing a simple grapple. The face rendering is pathetic. At least rendering should have been done properly. No wrestler looks even closely the way they should look in game. I did a digital download. Wish I could return it and get my money back.
