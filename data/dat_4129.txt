I have played all kinds of PC/XBox/PS3 games throughout my years, and this is (IMO) by far the best.  The only game to supercede its position was Borderlands (1).  Like guns?  Millions O' guns and variations.  The storyline is good and most enjoyable is the humor injected into it.  Re-playablity is the best in any game I have owned.  With multiple classes to play and an increasing difficulty level, there are countless hours to be enjoyed.  Online multiplay is fluid and balanced.  Don't pass this up.  DO NOT be deterred by having to install STEAM to play this game, the bad reviews are from the .001% that couldn't get it right.  Price is right, Season Pass is highly recommended.
