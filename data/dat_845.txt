If you had fun flying Microsoft FS or X Plane, don't expect to do the same with this bomb. The programmers created a monster that is very complex and complicated to fly.  It's difficult just to fly it on a bombing mission and a total waste on aerial combat.  Get the trial version and see for yourself or you'll be pissing off $40.
