The activation code I was given is &#34;invalid.&#34;  Trying to get this resolved is not easy.  You are sent to the Encore site and have to submit a request for a new code which is apparently not automated and half an hour later has still not arrived.  Rather defeats the purpose of an instant download.  There is no instant.
