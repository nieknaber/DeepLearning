I got the PC digital download of NBA 2k14. Its not all too different than NBA 2k13. The improvements in the game are minor. Even still, as far as basketball games go this is a fun game to play. I lessened my rating by one star due to the improvements being minor and the online service being down often. Let us also hope that they do patch the PC version this year as well.
