I played this game for hours and hours as a kid.  10 years later and its still great! I love this game so much and still play it for hours now that I have it again.  A fun fact about this game, it was programmed by a wizard.  One single person programmed the whole code for this game, then other people did the art and sound and other mics.  It's really impressive that you can have a park with rides running and individual AI's for thousands of guests and the game use so little resources.
