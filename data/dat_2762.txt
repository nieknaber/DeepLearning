Thief was one of my favorite games when it first came out. In fact, I liked it so much that I wanted to play it on a better system, so I upgraded my computer for the first time. (And had more fun with it!) This is still a game that's worth playing due to its importance in PC gaming history, and generally being fun all around. I'd recommend picking it up to anyone.
