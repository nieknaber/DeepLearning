The game pack was a great mix of some early 90's nostalgia which includes some greats like the Sonic trilogy, Comix Zone, Gunstar Heroes, Alien Soldier, Toe Jam and Earl, Vectorman, along with the first 2 Streets of Rage.  If the far superior Streets of Rage 3 was included it would have made it perfect.  However there is a lot of fluff here.  Maybe it's because I never played many of these games when they were released but I found that despite there being 48 games I only really saw myself playing 15 maybe.  The rest haven't aged particularly well or I just wasn't very interested and therefore didn't connect with the nostalgia factor.  That all said I paid only $5 and for that price you can't really beat it.  At that price you can add all the excess you want as long as there are still great strong titles in here, which I found to be just great!
