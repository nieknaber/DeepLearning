For anyone who has lived on an island, be it surrounded by salt or fresh water, living on an island CAN BE AWESOME !  This by far is my most FAVORITE of all the expansions..UNLIKE into the future, I have ( had ) a considerable amount of playtime with this.  The houses were awesome !  Land, an water-worthy. The clothing wasn't bad either. I think there were hair styles too, but I used a few previously made Sims to jump into this new venue.  Another expansion I HIGHLY RECOMMEND is Seasons ( on the disk expansion pack- saves you TIME an FRUSTRATION downloading, etc )  I recomend buying the disk expansion pack s for sake if youdo what I did. I lived on an island, north-north east Arkansas, on the mighty Missiippii river. Hunting club. It was awesome when noone else was ever around. Quiet an peaceful.
