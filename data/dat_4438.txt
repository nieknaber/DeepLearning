This is the 2nd game in the last couple of months that I have purchased and have been unable to download due to a virus.  There should be some exceptions in refunds if this happens, it could just be removed from my orders so I wouldn't be able to play.  Think I'll just buy on disk from now on, very disappointing!!!
