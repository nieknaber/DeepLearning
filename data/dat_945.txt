I'll be candid, I don't generally like MMO's.  My friends always tried to get me to play different ones with them and I always got bored after hours of grinding, trying to reach the next milestone.  I was never a big fan of paying a monthly premium just to enjoy my games so we tended to stray towards the free ones which didn't always have the best graphics either.  My friends somehow managed to get me to invest $60 towards the purchase of this game and I must say, I'm glad I did.<br /><br />Guild Wars 2 does many things right for me.  The battle system is well-paced and requires a bit of skill for each encounter.  Sure, you can stand in one spot and trade attacks with your enemies, but it allows the capability of dodging attacks and spells if you pay attention and move around.<br /><br />The other great thing is how everyone is on the same team.  You can't steal kills from your fellow online players, nor take their loot.  Everything is set up in such a way that it benefits you to help others rather than to see them as competition.  Whereas in some other MMO's you will not be rewarded for helping a random player kill an enemy, in Guild Wars 2 you gain experience and the possibility of it dropping loot for you.<br /><br />The last great thing I'll mention about the game is the event system it has in place.  There are different, unique events that happen in each area at specific times.  Some are rather mundane (i.e. killing a herd of minotaurs that are rampaging towards a city) while others feel rather epic (i.e. killing an evil ice mage that just summoned a hoard of ice monsters and is trying to resurrect an evil demon).  Some of them can be soloed but I found that a lot of them require the help of other players on the server.  In most cases, if it was a big event then a lot of people would quickly find their way to the area to take on these particular events as they tended to have bigger rewards.  The events also change what happens in an area depending on the outcome. (i.e.  If you lose an event then a particular door may be closed, preventing access to a certain area.  Or a specific faction occupying a town if the event is lost.)<br /><br />I shouldn't just say good things about the game as every game does have its own drawbacks.  There are two in particular that I can think of at the moment.  First, glitches.  I've noticed issues with some quests in the game being unable to complete as the NPC's are absent from the areas.  My friends say they saw my position on a map when I was nowhere near the specified location (majority of the time it's right).  A couple times when partying for a dungeon we had issues with getting everyone actually into the dungeon.  I'm sure that over time these issues will be addressed and the game will be made even better with updates.<br /><br />Second, the storyline (at least for my race) seems rather dull and non-engaging.  At times it's hilarious because of the bad voice-acting which makes it fun to make fun of with friends (aka like watching a B-movie with company).  My friends seem to like the stories to their own races so maybe it's just me being a bit picky or just that the Norn are a bunch of idiots.  (Sorry, Norn.  You're endearing, but I can only stand your cliche lines so much.)<br /><br />In summary, the game is great.  It's not without its own problems but they're easy to overlook.  You don't have to pay a monthly fee to enjoy this game.  The game is so much better if you have other people to share it with.  I recommend it as a great change of pace to what would be another monotonous MMO.
