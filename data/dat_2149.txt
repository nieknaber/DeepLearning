This is the worst game of all time, as it stands. I have an amazing computer (Brand new custom build - Intel i5-4670, 16 GB (4x4) Corsair Vengeance DDR3 RAM, AMD Radeon R9 200 series, etc), and this game runs like absolute s*** unless I put everything to minimum quality. Not worth the $40 from Black Friday sale, and I wish it could be returned. Activision and Infinity Ward deserve to go bankrupt over something as s*** as this. The people with 5-star reviews were probably paid to write them, as any advice they gave on improving performance was terrible. I am a computer person and know how to work with them well; this game is s***.
