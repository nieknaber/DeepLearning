Don't have time for a detailed review, but I have to say something about this game. If you want your hand held, and you want everything to jump out at you, go elsewhere, you won't last long in this game. If you want a unique, gripping, rewarding, and overall outstanding gaming experience (that you will never forget), go for Dark Souls. This is, quite simply, one of the best games I've ever played. Currently, I rank it #1 on my list. Once you play for a few hours, it grabs hold, and you gain some understanding that I feel only players of Dark Souls would grasp. A few quick points:<br /><br />- The beauty in this game is the sheer difficulty and lack of direction (something a lot of people complain about). To me, this leaves so much mystery to the game. The lore is picked up here and there through the world instead of being shoved down your throat.<br /><br />- I love the mechanics. If you're not thinking on your toes, you die, simple as that. DO NOT try to play this with keyboard and mouse. It was made for Xbox/Playstation, pick up a wired controller if you don't have one, or a wireless adapter.<br /><br />- This game is not for the easily frustrated or those who want to be guided through every turn. You might spend hours (sometimes) trying to take down a boss, but when it goes down, the feeling of accomplishment is unmatched.<br /><br />I've ran this on a Windows 7 machine for 40+ hours without a single issue. What more can I say? Buy it, and don't rate it unless you've put a few hours into playing it. Also, please, keep in mind what you're getting. Don't rate it for how hard it is compared to games you're used to. It's refreshing to see this approach.
