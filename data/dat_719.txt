Absolutely DO NOT waste your money on this game, especially if you have Windows 7, it doesn't work. Customer service at Focus Interactive is absolutely horrible. I asked them several times over the course of the year to help me but they wouldn't message back at all. I will never buy any of their products because of this mistreatment I received. I'll just go back to playing Simcity 4 even though it's extremely old, it is a much better game anyway.
