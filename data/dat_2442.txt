Not very happy with this product. I just downloaded it for my Windows 8.1 system and found that the RunTime compnonents in the game were not compatible with the Windows 8 system. In the past, I have used games that were from other platforms on this system as far back as Windows XP and they ran just fine, so that tells me that Southpeak has some major programming issues within their department. What HAS happened is that when the screen loads, it iscompletely white and shows no graphics. So, if you have a newer system, this game is not worth the $4.99
