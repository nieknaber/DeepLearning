The fact that I don't have to go all the way to Wal-mart is good enough, and then there's the simplicity. Within minutes I had my code ready to use! If you have credit card problems with Sonys playstation store then just buy this! Its faster and easier and you never have to waste any time dealing with Sonys problems, just buy the code, write it down, and type into PS Store and you're ready to go! However there was one concern, although it did come up saying the code was valid for $20, it did take about 40 seconds or more to actually add it to the wallet rather than the typical 10 seconds or less with cards you buy at store. Other than that, this is just perfect! :D
