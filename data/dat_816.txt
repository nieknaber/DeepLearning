While EA was promoting The Sims 4 they placed huge emphasis on how cool their new build mode tools are and, yes, I'll grant you that those are pretty cool. You can adjust wall heights, have a wide variety of foundation heights and can place objects at any position between grid squares by holding down the 'alt' key.<br /><br />But the actual sims are lackluster at best, having very little room to develop definite personalty despite EA's claims that they are &#34;smarter&#34; and &#34;weirder.&#34; There are also a truckload of bugs with the multitasking system and it seems to me that about 1 in every 3 inter-sim interactions don't work at all.<br /><br />If you already have Sims 2 or 3, save your money. If you've never played a Sims game before at least wait a few months until the game goes on sale.
