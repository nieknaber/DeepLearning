When I close my eyes at night to go to sleep I'm thinking about my current save file  in Crusader Kings 2. I toss and turn in bed fretting about the ongoing war with several branches of my dynasty. That thoughtless marriage I made 200 years earlier really came back to bite me in the ass. Not to mention I have a tubercular lesbian heir to my three kingdom empire. Should I imprison and execute my celibate wife?  If i remarry I might get that son i've been aiming for. If I wasn't excommunicated for assassinating the previous Pope maybe i'd have been able to get that divorce...<br />This game stimulates me to the point that I try to limit my exposure to it. It's crazy because the graphics are straight from 1997, and really all you at doing is staring at a map for 7 hours. But that 7 hours is gone in what feels like 15 minutes. Oh yeah this is a good review. Well I'm going to go play, this is taking too long.
