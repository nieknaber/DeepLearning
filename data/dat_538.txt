A fun game.  You make strings of matches instead of moving pieces into place to make matches.  Still a lot of fun, and interesting to see if you can find all of the pieces that can be connected. Then at the end of every 4 boards you play a find the different things between two pictures.  There is also a hidden object game between each part of the 4-part game.  If you like other match 3 I would recommend this game.  My 5 year old was able to pick it up and play it with little difficulty.
