I almost didn't buy this game when I read all the bad reviews on Amazon, but they had a sale for $29.99, so I bought it.   It did take a while to download and install and update and origin has that website set up that takes a little getting used to, but its a great game.  No problems or glitches - I think that was all fixed during whatever patches they released for it. I highly recommend this game. Very fun and addicting 1st person shooter.
