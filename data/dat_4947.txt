What can I say, it's ROCKSTAR.<br />I already own this game on the Xbox360, and just thought I'd buy it for pc as well.<br />Graphics are awesome, but what always seem to capture me, is the storyline, and gameplay.<br />Now I have this song stuck in my head, &#34;I ALWAYS KILL THE THINGS I LOVE&#34;<br />Youtube it, not the one from the game, but the orginal.<br />The super old school setting this game's story is in, is a total blast.
