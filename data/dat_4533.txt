As far as the technical side goes, it works fine for the most part, with only a few minor glitches here and there (I run a an advanced system with a 1GB dedicated graphics card).  I would appreciate a patch or something released by Focus to correct some of the bugs, but I still haven't seen one.  Speaking of the game play itself, I would say in some ways it is better than Sim City 4 and in other ways it is worse.  The actual building of the city is harder due to the lack of a grid system, though more realistic in that you can make curved bridges, as well as roads that can go under bridges.  The global trading system is pretty cool, though when you begin trading between cities, it can become pretty tedious keeping up with all the different commodities.  In regards to the trading system, the way the tokens work is also pretty cool, as far as the construction of landmarks is concerned.  Sim City 4 has many more mass transit options, and I think this game would see some improvement if they added any of those to it (like ferries or monorail).  In addition, the financial side of running the city is also a bit simplified, it is clear the designers decided to focus more on trade than taxing, and for the most part I think they did a good job, the world layout is unique and works well.  At any rate, you should find it enjoyable if you like city building games, though it would get another star from me if they would send out patches for the game periodically (Like Star craft 2)
