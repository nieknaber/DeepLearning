First off all - please disregard most of these reviews - as they were posted BEFORE this DLC was even released.    I'll start by saying this:  If you're purchasing this expansion pass for the story, do yourself a favor and pass.  There are 3 new story missions, all of which consist of re-hashing existing levels - as well as enemies.  It literally took me a little over half an hour to finish the story.  Zero cut scenes.  There's basically nothing here.    If you're a PS user, you get 2 new strikes.  Again, nothing groundbreaking.  The strike on Mars is probably the better of the two, but it's painfully short.    Finally, the main reason many gamers are ponying up $20 is so they can play through the new raid.  If you've played through the Vault of Glass, you know that it's easily the best aspect of Destiny.  Team-based puzzles, gunfights, etc.  I've yet to finish the new raid (Crota's End), but again, it's the crown jewel of this pass.    2/5 stars.  I honestly want to give it 1/5, but because the new raid is quite entertaining, I'll bump it up to 2/5.    All in all, there just isn't enough here to warrant the price tag.  Destiny is a good (but not great) game.  There was a ton of potential to expand the Destiny universe, but sadly, Bungie has dropped the ball.  1 step forward, 2 steps back.
