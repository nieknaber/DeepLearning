The Mac Download for \\"Dragon Age Origins: Ultimate Edition\\" wouldn't download the entire package.  I was able to play \\"Dragon Age Origins\\", though with some technical problems where it would auto quit once in a while without allowing me to save, but was completely unable to play the \\"Dragon Age Awakening\\" or do any of the extra content that was suppose to be included with the Ultimate Edition.  Checking online, it is a ridiculously common problem experienced by a lot of Mac users, and there is no good way that I found after hours of searching to fix it.<br /><br />I thought the game itself was amazing, but the product as a whole was just a disappointing experience, seeing as I didn't get to play the entire thing...<br /><br />If I were to recommend this to anyone, it would be for the PC Version of the game.  Its the original form, and few flaws have been found with it.  EA just bit the dust when they did a horrible job developing it for a Mac
