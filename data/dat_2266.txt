I enjoyed the gameplay of Dragon Age, and would recommend it to people who are interested in a solo gaming experience.  Downsides that kept it from 5 Star Rating would be:  1) No multi-player option.  2) Failed attempt at social website for 'login and load your character\\" - they just didn't seem to make it good enough to want.  3) NO PROMO codes for the download version. You really are getting the plain jane, and no mayo.  All that to say, it met the bang-for-buck challenge.  bvfshopper
