I decided to import the CPP from Japan to go with my US 3DS XL and I'm glad I did. It works perfectly with the domestic 3DS XL and really makes playing MGS3 so much better. The CPP is surprisingly light, and while it does add a lot of bulk to the already large XL it feels great in hand. I wish more games supported this accessory.
