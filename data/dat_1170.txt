The game was a huge let down, there was literally no difference in graphics from Stronghold 2 other then a few new buildings. They took away all of the innovative features (such as crime and punishment) and replaced them with simplified mechanics. The Campaigns are more detached then that of Enemy Territory: Quake Wars and lastly the multiplayer doesn't exist. The game is dead and was rushed, the quality that the series is known for dies here.
