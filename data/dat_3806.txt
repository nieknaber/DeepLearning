Game is a blast. Playing FPS for almost three decades. This is in my top 10. Runs perfect. Great attributes borrowed from other games like TF2 and the BF games. Cute, funny, and takes skill and teamwork.<br /><br />Only gripe is that voip is enabled by default. Hoping they patch that out.<br /><br />Not sure how anyone could have complaints about this game. Sorry if you didn't know it was a shooter or if your specs are too low. Any sort of read up on the game would have told you those things ahead of time.
