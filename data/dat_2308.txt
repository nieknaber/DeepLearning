I had to register my games through origin and then download them through there as well in order to get it to work. I believe the Spore original download is out of date and that was why this was necessary. It is really easy to do and I highly recommend doing it this way. Create an origin account and then click file, and claim product. Then copy the product code from Amazon and claim it. It downloads faster and gives you access to the online content.<br /><br />Also, the galaxy addition is so-so... maybe I just haven't gotten far enough into it but so far its a lot of reading and just doing what they tell you to and less free play like the previous levels.
