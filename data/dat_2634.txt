This is a pretty cool game. I like time management games and this one was fun. Some of the mini-games where a bit hard to figure out, even with instructions.  I didn't purchase my version from amazon, but the one I purchased had a bug in it that wouldn't allow you to play one of the mini-games unless you skipped over the instructions for it.  Definitely annoying to have to reboot the game in order to skip over that, but other than that the game play itself is pretty neat. You have to drive around picking up supplies from different areas of the map and either delivery them directly or combine them with other ingredients to make a dish.
