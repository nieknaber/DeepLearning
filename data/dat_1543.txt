Since the PSN is often on the fritz and doesn't allow it's members to &#34;ADD FUNDS&#34; via credit/debit, this is a good alternative method to buying games. Simply buy the card from Amazon.com and enter the code given after purchase into the &#34;Redeem Codes&#34; area on the PSN via PC, PS3 or PSP. I have purchased two already and in my experience the codes were delivered in minutes if not instant!
