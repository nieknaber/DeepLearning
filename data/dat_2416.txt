If someone asked me to show them evidence that video games can be art, the first game I would show them would be Thief: Gold.<br /><br />It has historical importance as the first first-person stealth game.  The envy of developers who wish they made it.  Many have been Looking Glass understudies.  This old dog still has a few tricks to teach the games of today (I won't grind an axe about the reboot here, except to say that it dispenses with a lot of the freedom and has a very different focus, though fans of the old games are completely divided as to whether the new game is good on its own terms or not).<br /><br />Here are some tips to get the best experience:<br /><br />First thing to do when you get the game is to apply the 'tfix' patch; this ensures that the cut-scenes will all play, you can use modern hd resolutions, and it allows you to then apply the separate hd texture patch (if you wish it).  Then install openal for good reverb on the sound propogation.<br /><br />The intro and end credits might not play on their own in this distribution, in which case you have to select them in the main menu to see them.<br /><br />The game is a study in atmosphere and immersion.  The feeling of being somewhere you're not and paying a price if you're caught.  The moody, ambient musical loops, and alien colour scheme.  You'll do yourself a disservice by not playing at night without any distractions.<br /><br />The controls can be intimidating at first but become natural with time.  Rebind the keys to allow strafing and free mouselook.  Maybe consider tweaking the inventory buttons as well.<br /><br />Don't bother blocking in combat, just move in, strike, move out/side step (although you should use combat only as a last resort, unless you're looking for a challenge).<br /><br />Try not to quicksave overly often or it may suck out all the tense moments.<br /><br />I recommend playing on normal at first, even if you deprive yourself of extra content with the extra objectives higher difficulty gives you.  It is more liberating to get to use Garrett's full (sometimes lethal) toolset and do whatever the situation requires.<br /><br />Try to get accustomed to the A.I. patterns.  They have different alert states.  Push the boundaries and experiment.  Don't be  hesitant to save before trying something, or you may find yourself back at the beginning.<br /><br />USE YOUR EARS.  Footsteps--your own and your enemies'--are crucial to pinning their location and knowing when the coast is clear.<br /><br />Pay attention to the light gem; you're effectively invisible when it is completely dark.  Put your sword and bow away if you don't need them as they increase your visibility.  Equipping a fire arrow will light you up like a beacon.  Crouch when you don't need to be standing.<br /><br />The weakest thing about the game is the mantling, particularly on ladders.  Garrett hates ladders.  You might want to try the 'attach to ladder automatically' toggle and see if that makes things better.<br /><br />Drink in the surroundings; the world is detailed but it doesn't place the detail in your path so that you can't miss it like a forced cut-scene.  Eavesdrop on every conversation and read every note to get a feel for the world.<br /><br />Some people get dismayed when they meet some of the stranger critters of the Thief universe, so consider that a forewarning--you're not entering the real world, and it's not -just- about stealing (although sneaking is a permanent constant).<br /><br />Personally, I think the enemy variety adds to the escapism of playing the game, and it definitely forces you to come up with alternative strategies than how you might deal with guards.<br /><br />However if this doesn't sound like something you'd appreciate, Thief 2 might be more up your alley--it's definitely focused more on the stealing.
