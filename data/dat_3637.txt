This game deserves all the hype it got when it first came out. SE did great making more servers so overcrowding and difficulty getting on the game are things of the past.The game is so flexible it can be enjoyed by most anyone. Most gamers prefer getting into the battles and that is definitely there for them. I am more into the crafting part. It is amazing for us crafters. Oh and for the ladies? SE is starting to catch on that there are more than men/boys on the game. Lots of age diversity as well as gender. Try it. :)
