Apparently this is the wrong kind of imaginary money for a $60 membership. X-box wouldn't honor it, the seller never responded to my requests to change or refund. Microsoft MARKETING SCAM, I switched my kids platform to Play Station where the membership is free. It's going to cost Microsoft at least 10 times what they scammed my son for in lost revenue.
