I ordered this game for Mac & have never been able to get it to play. It crashes every time!!!!! The best any support could do was to tell me that I needed to fix it myself. When I buy something I expect it to work! If it doesn't work YOU need to fix it or give me a full refund! I don't know if I like the game...I never got to play it.
