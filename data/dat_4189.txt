In this game, you basically run through levels trying to locate all the treasures & eliminate all the the baddies.  It REALLY reminds me of a game called Super Cow!  Super Cow is superior - it was funny with a silly story line & better gameplay.  This game isn't bad, but I'd rather play Super Cow again.
