For the price I paid (on sale), this is a great collection of both REAL Batman Arkham games (the ones by Rocksteady, not the faux Origins game made by a WB wannabe team of nobodies from failed developers led by the guy formerly behind the Prototype games (Radical that was fired by Activision for failing too many times to make another Call of Duty)) with all their DLC and Steam keys.  It also works well for anyone who wants to have the option to install their Batman titles as often as possible because WB (the publisher) limits the number of times you can install a key within a certain period of time.<br /><br />Heaven forbid you try to install your game to more than one device and play them at different times (not simultaneously).  Or if you have hardware failure within 30 days and you have to reinstall.  Or anything else that might happen (ie., you change your motherboard, you change your video card, you reinstall your OS and update your firmware, etc.).  WB uses a lifetime limit on how many times you can reinstall.<br /><br />So what does that have to do with this pack?  Amazon Digital Video Games guarantees you a key that works.  If yours stops working because WB is stupid, contact Amazon Customer Service and they guarantee you another one that works.  That's worth buying at Amazon DVG versus anywhere else because nowhere else does this.
