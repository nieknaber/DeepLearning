Save your money, this game is junk.   The game locks up with a video error. As it is downloaded software there are no instructions or patches available to get past the error. It should be removed from Amazon. The company that wrote this junk should be ashamed of this product... Well that is only if it weren't for idiots like me that purchase unsupported software lining their pockets with money. The Hell's Kitchen trademark takes a big hit here for allowing the name to be used on this junk.
