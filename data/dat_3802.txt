Literally every time I go to play this there is some BS problem with it. Why do I need to have an internet connection to play this??? Why did EA make a game that only works online??? Why can't EA's software connect to it's own servers??? Why is EA still in business??? Literally (and I mean literally) every time I go to play this game, something goes wrong. I either spend 30 minutes to an hour restarting and yelling at my computer or I flat out give up.<br /><br />The game itself is very fun and deserving of 4 or 5 stars. Too bad EA decided to take a steaming dump on top of something great.<br /><br />Good job EA, you've turned an entire community against you in hopes of higher profits. I hope you enjoy losing customers because I for one do not trust you. I will never by another game from you and I will proudly speak negatively of you til the day I die.<br /><br />Sim City, pronounced dead- cause of death EA.
