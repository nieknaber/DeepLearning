Great game, a lot of things need to be changed though. Fire spread is insanely fast. If you don't send fire trucks to the fire right away the whole block will be on fire which is ridiculous. The very big fires are fun once in awhile. But I seem to get two big ones at the same time sometimes which is basically the time to quit the game and start a new one because it's way to overwhelming. I'm sure their is a way to slow fire spread. But that is a major issue with this game.
