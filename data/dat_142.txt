This is by far my favorite entry in the Grand Theft Auto series. I originally got it for Xbox, then Xbox 360, but the PC version has got the best graphics. Yes, GTA IV definitely has better graphics, but as far as gameplay, San Andreas takes the cake. ALL of it. The '90s music, the gangster-hood atmosphere, the hilarious NPC dialogue, the missions, and so many more things make this one of the best PS2 classics as well as just one of the best video games of all time. Even after you beat the storyline missions, which are very entertaining and enthralling if I might add, there is just SO much more to explore and fun to be had. I would definitely recommend this game to anyone who has played GTA before, and to people who are new to the series. Happy Gaming, Ladies and Gents! :)
