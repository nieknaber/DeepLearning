Game Was Challenging. It does have great graphics. Origin did have a little trouble recognizing the purchase, and you have to sign up with Origin. If you don't log in directly from Origin and try to launch the game through the games direct link on the desktop some of the features are disabled which is somewhat dissapointing.
