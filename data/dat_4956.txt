I'm in my early 20s, and I find this game to be quite entertaining... at first.  It's up to about 10 levels in that I find this game to be VERY repetitive and annoying.  First of all, I have to deal with annoying customers all day, and I don't need a game that gives me even more rude customers to deal with.  Second of all, you do a lot of point-and-click work, which gets old really quick.  There is no real objective to each level of this game other than to make ends meet.  I do not recommend this game to anyone who has to deal with bad customers for a living.  And unless you want to prepare your children to enter minimum-waged, hectic sales positions when they grow up, keep this game away from your children as well.
