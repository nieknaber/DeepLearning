This bundle seems like a great deal until you realize that nobody plays MW2 or MW2.5 (excuse me - I mean, MW3) anymore due to the lag issues, lack of dedicated servers, hackers, lack of updates and patches, bugs, and overpowered weapons/killstreaks. Then you realize that you're paying $40 for one playable game. COD4 was great - quite balanced actually, and dedicated servers with mods made it even more fun. It was actually worth buying back then.<br /><br />MW2 and M2.5? What a joke.<br /><br />Just save yourself the extra $20 and get COD4. There's a reason this bundle was made; it's an effort to make MW2 and MW2.5 somehow more appealing. I would regret spending even $10 on MW3. Most of my friends have uninstalled it already. Don't be fooled by youtube videos; the real experience is basically like spawn, die, spawn in front of an enemy, die, spawn, get one or two kills, die to a predator missile, spawn, get one kill and then host migration, die by falling through the map, spawn, get MOAB'ed by a hacker.
