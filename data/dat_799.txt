I love PuzzleQuest, having found it for my Wii, first. My husband has since taken over the Wii and likes to play games I'm not very good at and don't much enjoy, so I purchased this downloadable PuzzleQuest for my computer so I could play without disturbing his game playing.<br /><br />It takes a little while to load, but the game functions the same as on the Wii. The graphics are the same, being slightly blurry depending on the resolution, which is the only bummer. I have to have the game in full screen mode, which blocks out my other windows, and for some reason when I minimize the game window, it is very slow and takes a minute to maximize again. Otherwise I love this game!
