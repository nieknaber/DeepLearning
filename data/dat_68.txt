I have spent the past 30 hours trying to download and install this game from Amazon!!! After multiple download attempts, the downloader FINALLY managed to complete a full download without a fatal error. That's saying a lot in itself since this download takes about 5 hours each time.    But that's not the worst part!!! Even after 15-20 hours of failed downloads, the supposedly intact files refused to install. Several more fatal errors later, I ended up baby-sitting the installer for about 10 minutes of clicking \\"retry\\" literally every 8 seconds until giving up and telling it to skip the outro file. (Apparently Amazon's copy is corrupted.)    THEN... I tried to start the game and felt hopeful for the first time in the last day and a half. The intro menu actually loaded! HOWEVER, the only thing it let me do is follow links to register my game or lead me to advertising for the sequel. EVEN NOW, EVERY TIME I TRY TO CLICK THE \\"LAUNCH GAME\\" BUTTON, IT CRASHES!!! I never even had the chance to input my registration code.  BIGGEST. WASTE. OF. TIME. ... EVER!!!  (Not to mention a waste of $5.)    I'm sure this is a great game, just DON'T BUY THE DOWNLOAD!!!
