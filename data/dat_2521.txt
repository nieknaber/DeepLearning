I truly enjoy sniper games on my PC.  As such, I have a good few.  Of all those I have, Sniper Ghost Warrior, [[ASIN:B00DP7CKTE Call of Duty 2 [Online Game Code]]] and [[ASIN:B0009Z3LGG Sniper Elite]] are those I play most often.<br /><br />Obviously the downside to these programs is after playing them a few times you not only get the hang of what to do, you start anticipating the baddies here and there, preset yourself with the appropriate armament and/or ammunition, etc.  That's no fault of the game, it's just how things go.  This is a very enjoyable game.
