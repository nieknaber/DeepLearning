The game itself is decent - good play mechanics (except crafting - hate the crafting)..  Uptime on servers and the ability to access the servers in the first month (including Beta) has been  horrible.Square Enix did not do a very good job of estimating the number of people that were going to play based on their pre-orders.  I quit trying to play after 3 weeks.  I've gone back to Guild Wars2 where I can get on without a problem.
