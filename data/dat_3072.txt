If you wish to purchase these cards to buy a game and first want to try out the 10$ option like me,and then you get the first code you think: wow this is pretty quick and hassle free! Well think again! The second time you place the same order or maybe even a larger amount your order is NOT going to clear due to security reasons or so it would seem. Its written on the transaction page that it may take upto 4 hours! Also do not place any further orders in this period as they all may stack up and not clear.<br />I know its all due to security reasons but can be a hassle if yo wanted to purchase a game or a dlc and didn't have 4 hours to wait.<br />Note to amazon:- If a guy has his credit/debit card info and its his account(he has the email&password) it could'nt really be a fake could it? Especially if he's buying psn cards and not something over a 1000$ worths!
