Volition built on the Rock Star GTA model and improved it. This game is well written, irreverent, and funny. The voice acting is excellent. The game play is exciting and outlandish with an amazing array of character customization. The game physics are a bit arcade-like, but that hardly detracts from the fun. Well worth it!
