This is a very playable game.  I am not a hard core gamer.  I have played newer hack and slash type RPGs that have an interface that is easier to use.  Another complaint is that magic seems to be kind of weak.<br />As far as the story and other game play go this game hits on all points.  I would recomend this game with the warning that it is an older game.
