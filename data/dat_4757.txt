People give SimCity a lot of hate, even after nearly a year of updates. The game plays fine, most of the problems have been fixed and they will soon be adding offline mode.<br /><br />People blow stuff out of proportion all the time, they are idiots, but I chose to take a chance and I was happily surprised.<br /><br />Good game and a good way to waste some time.
