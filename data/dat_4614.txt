I have Uplay version of basegame, but this DLC ONLY works with the Steam version of the basegame. Yes, product page says that it needs Steam activated basegame, but it does not say anywhere the Uplay activated basegame is a no go, since any user would just expect this to be a standard warning for all Steam games sold here on Amazon.<br /><br />Oh and item is not refundable.
