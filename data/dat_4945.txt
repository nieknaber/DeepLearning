I played through the original Prototype when it first came on on the PC and had a blast. I loved the mechanics, the open-world feeling, and the chaos of the character. So, when I found that they were offering Prototype 2 + the DLC for $10, how could I pass that up?<br /><br />I wish I had.<br /><br />Prototype 2 has a laundry list of PC problems, ranging from failure to start to performance decreases to the point of unplayability. For a listing of some of the bugs and their fixes, there is \\"[...]\\", and a Reddit thread about all the problems at \\"[...]\\". However, with my gaming rig that is able to play every other title very well (Dual Radeon 5700's, 8GB Ram, and Core i7 CPU), this game would not load for me. I got a Blue-Screen-of-Death every single time I tried to start the game fullscreen. I couldn't play the game windowed with a mouse+keyboard because the mouse would move outside of the game window and clicks outside of the game would cause the game to lose focus and minimize. I attempted to play with an Xbox 360 controller, but then, after around 15 minutes each time I loaded the game, the FPS would drop to around 15-20, making the game nearly unplayable.<br /><br />I have also found that the development company, Radical Entertaintment, went out of business shortly after releasing this game, and will not be supporting it any longer. This means that no patches will be released to fix any of the critical bugs that plague this game, meaning if you can't run it now, you probably never will be able to.<br /><br />I finally decided I'd had enough and would wait for the console price to go down.<br /><br />TL/DR: Do NOT buy this terrible PC port of a game. You will regret it.
