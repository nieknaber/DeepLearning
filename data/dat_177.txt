I generally like games of this type, but this is very poorly done.  I downloaded the demo and tried it.  After about 1/2 and hour, I had managed to get the hang of it and that 1/2 hour was kinda fun.  The trouble is, that is all the fun there is to be had from this.  The game doesn't change at all as the levels progress.  It's just a long succession of slight tweaks to a balance.    Occasionally, your castle is attacked, and this should be an improvement over the monotony.  It isn't.  The game is so poorly designed that I had to repeatedly click the \\"attack\\" button at least a hundred times to win a simple battle at times.  It wasn't as if it were a hard battle - some of those I didn't take any losses on.  The designers seem not to care.    Don't waste your time, or your seven bucks.
