Do you like playing games? Then this is not the game for you. On the other hand, if you like staring at a countdown timer that promises to try to reconnect every 20 minutes or so, then this might be your game. If you are old enough to miss the days of AOL dial-up, and trying to log in to there servers during peak times, this game might be for you. If you enjoy video glitches, and always wanted to be a beta tester, then this game might be for you. If you like getting into a game, and having it drop you due and all your progress to that point due to an internet connection, then this game might be for you. In other words, if you are a masochistic self hating person, this game might be for you.<br /><br />If not, then I suggest you stay far, far, far away from the game for at least a few weeks. It might be a good game, it might not. I don't know, I haven't been able to play it much to find out. It is good for rage inducement though. Eventually it will get patched a few times and they will load balance the servers appropriately (or enough people will quit trying to play) and it might be a good game. On that happy day, go out and buy the game. Or wait a few weeks after that, and it will probably be on sale. Whatever you do, don't buy it in March, or probably April.....
