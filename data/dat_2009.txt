As a Hearts of Iron I and III player, I knew about Paradox and on a whim I started looking at PC games on Amazon.  I must have hit a sale as I found CK II for $9.99.  After some quick research I snapped it up, and have been addicted since.<br /><br />The game really shows the issues that you have as a Feudal ruler.  And the danger of a ruler change, as suddenly your friendly nobles now want your new ruler's blood.<br /><br />It's certainly less complex than HOI III, but it's not easy at all.  Definitely suggest reading the FAQ's at the official forums.  Lots of replayability.  Really enjoying building a strong Polish kingdom, though we'll see how that goes when the Mongols show.<br /><br />If you like a good strategy game, easy to recommend.
