Bought this game on a whim as I stumbled over it and remebered playing Heroes 4 with my siblings years and years ago and figured it would be fun to play again.<br />The new game has much better graphics and details to it and works great however I have to say that miss the old style a little bit as well.<br />Nothing really bad to say about it though, once you get used to the new features it's a good game.
