The very little time I have actually been able to get in and play it has been so much fun, but this was a horrible fail on EA's part, what where they thinking? Let the people be able to play the single player without internet access. I paid for this game but I cannot play it, if this does not get fixed they will get sued and I hope they do if it is not fixed. This is one of the biggest jokes of a company, they knew the servers wouldn't be able to handle the numbers and had 3 betas to know it was coming but they failed horribly. Do not buy this game until it is completely fixed. EA has destroyed SimCity's legacy, shame on EA for such horrible requirements and such stupidity on EA. EA has to be one of the dumbest companies out there.
