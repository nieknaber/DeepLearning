I like this one a lot.  It offers cute furniture and outfits!  I like to change things up quite frequently so I look for curtains and rugs and towels and clothing.<br /><br />Got it at a great price or I wouldn't have it at all and it is fun and I would recomment it even though I think my family thinks I have lost my noodle!!
