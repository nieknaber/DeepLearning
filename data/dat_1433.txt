I played this in the casino and really enjoyed it so I brought the home version; but at home it is not as much fun because rarely do the three kings of one color show up regardless of how long you play.  I think I played for three hours and got the kings three times.  I'm just glad the program was not set like this in the casino.  It's okay but I really am saying don't waste your time with this one if fun is what you are looking to have because you will become bored very quickly.
