If you purchase this you may not be able to \\"verify ownership\\" through EA servers even just to play the single player campaign. I installed the game on Saturday, had to call for support to \\"validate ownership\\". After 4 calls and 5 days the game still can not be played and EA is \\"working on a solution\\". They will \\"email me when they have one\\".
