I've owned every edition of Might and Magic: Heroes, and I have to say this one does not disappoint. The flickering pointer is gone with the last patch, and the graphics and game play have never been better. I love the changes they've added to the game this time around, which for me are a nice improvement.  For example you can actually convert a captured town to your Hero's alignment (for the price of some resources and gold), which is awesome when trying to build up large stacks of powerful minions that get along. The DRM does not bother me at all, it doesn't interfere with game play, and they need to make money to make more of these games.  The online integration is a nice edition, as you're rewarded with powerful items, heroes, abilities, and titles just for playing the game.  The online system is called the Conflux, and your account earns xp (as your account levels up you get access to higher level currency to buy better items, heroes, titles and abilities), items, and virtual currency from unlocking achievements, and just playing through the campaign or missions.  None of the extra rewards are required, but they're nice to have.  In summary if you've enjoyed the past editions of Might and Magic: Heroes, this is one you definitely won't want to pass up.
