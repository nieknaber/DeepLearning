I got this as a gift and we all have fond memories of games of past. These are no exception. There are loads of the classic games here, some great and some amazing, but don't be fooled, they are direct ports of the classics and your memory might be reminiscing on gameplay over graphics :p<br /><br />Well worth it if you want to relive your childhood or even want to show your child how games used to be.<br /><br />Retro to the max. Brilliant.
