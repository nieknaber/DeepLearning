I think this is what I would call a gamers game.  It is full of puzzles and collectible items.  The combat system is really easy to use and the combos are fluid.  Think this is one of those games that is not really going to hit the mainstream because of the comic book atmosphere and strange lore.  If you are like me, a giant nerd, this game is great.  They really nailed the traveling in this game by putting in a fast travel feature so that all of the backtracking that can hinder the fun of a game is removed.  Although it is full of secret things to find they are not essential to completing the game.  I found the puzzles to be fun and challenging without holding your hand.  This is something that is not for everyone, like in Dark Souls it is left up to the player to figure out how to progress.  I would recommend this to any of the hardcore gamers out there but casual gamers might want to be wary of this franchise.
