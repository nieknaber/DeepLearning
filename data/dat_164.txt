It's lovely but the game doesn't work well.  Because it is a linear game I cannot leave a room until I solve the puzzle but when I try to pick up objects it won't let me.  So I'm stuck only a few minutes into the game.  It's a shame because the graphics are beautiful and I will never see the rest of it.
