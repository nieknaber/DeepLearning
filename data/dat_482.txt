Although this game only activates on Origin and not on Steam I still think this bundle is a tremendous value for the money. I put well over 80 hours into Dragon Age Origins Ultimate Edition. Second game is not as good in my opinion but still worth giving a look if you're into the lore.  Origins terms of service are pretty broad and it gets me a little leary thinking about the nefarious things they could do that still doesn't detract (for me anyway) the awesome value of this bundle.
