We bought this as a Christmas gift as we were running out of ideas, but remember talking about how the characters in this game were icon and that people always talked about it.  Sounded like a simple concept, but we decided to try it out. Family played it for the holidays and had a blast.  Doesn't take long to get through the game, but very happy we bought this.
