SimCity's gameplay itself is excellent, with a myriad of fun and challenging situtations for you to explore.  It is every bit as fun as earlier versions, with the added bonus of present-day graphics and realism.  However, I would strongly discourage a purchase at this time.  In a move that lacked forethought and failed to consider the unreliable nature of modern technology, the game's producers decided to make it ENTIRELY DEPENDENT on a series of online servers. Unfortunately, but not surprisingly, these servers have encountered problems that prevent users from being able to play the game.  I have been kicked out of the game multiple times due to these issues and have lost many cities.  Occasionally, I have been forced to replay the tutorial, which then fails to load properly.  This is unacceptable performance from a game that cost me $60.  Until the producers unchain the game from its ridiculous internet dependence and/or fix the server problems, I'd recommend that you spend your money elsewhere.
