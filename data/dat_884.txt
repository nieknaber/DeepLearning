This game was very well made. I thoroughly enjoyed the main story and the other fun side quest. However. I hated the fact there was no guidence system. Such as a marker pointing to your quest location. I mainly found myself wondering the world trying to find it. But do not be discouraged by that. This game was brilliant in many way and is a favorite in my book.
