I've been playing FFXI on and off since 2004 and I didn't see this expansion coming. It was a very nice surprise. Download went smoothly and price was the same as all past ffxi full expansions. Now on to the content. The new Sacred City of Adoulin is AMAZING! Stunning, largest city in the game, or at least it feels that way and they still haven't released it in it's entirety. The music is great, love it so, the new zones are cool and of course everyone is joining the bandwagon of the two new jobs which I have to admit are cool too. What you are buying is the start of the expansion, Square Enix will be adding and building on this expansion for quite some time in the future, adding missions, quests, and new zones. FFXI is a constantly evolving MMO and it contributes to it's success and longevity. The content makes the game what it is as much as the great player base does and this expansion just adds to that. All past FFXi full expansions have never disappointed, they might take a while to truly finish and complete but it's always worth it in the end, always an amazing fun adventure. You can wait to buy the expansion and it might be a little cheaper later but most people are centered around Adoulin  right now and will be for quite some time so do yourself a favor if you've been playing for a long time or just started and plan to play quite a while buy this expansion. Let's have fun together and take the dive as Seekers of Adoulin~!<br /><br />Aleous of the Bismarck Server
