I've played every big game that's come along for the last 10 years, and this is the best of them all. If you can, get the series, This one, plus 2 and three. Its like playing a movie, where you get to make all the choices. Graphics are stunning even on the original. Make sure you have a good system for Mass Effect 2 and 3, but almost any system should be able to handle this one. I actually had some issues because this game has a couple of trouble spots in game because of the AMD FX series processors, there is a coding problem , but I finished the game, and all of my accomplishments transferred to part 2 flawlessly, same with part 3. I had 0 issues with Mass Effect 2 and 3 though. I'm playing the series again because I liked it so much, and surprisingly the choices you make really do affect the story line I've found out, just buy it, you will be glad you did, I was playing Skyrim before this one, and I haven't went back!!! looking forward to #4.
