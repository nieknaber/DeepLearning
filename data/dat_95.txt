This game is a joke....it works fine however for $40 I would expect a full game.  It basically came with four trains to use and keeps asking you if you want to buy new trains for quite a bit of money.  If the game was free, and on a mobile device I would expect this, not for a $40 upfront purchase. My eight year old son is constantly wondering why a game that cost so much cannot have the fun stuff in it.  Do not recommend at all and it freezes all the time. What a joke.
