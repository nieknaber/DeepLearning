This game is awesome.  Finally a move back towards the good old days of Battlefield 1942.  The game was clearly written for PC and then ported/limited for console, rather than being artificially limited out of the gate because of the current generation consoles sub par performance.  The downside is you're forced to use origin.  Origin sucks, and EA sucks for forcing it down our throats.  Game is pretty awesome otherwise.
