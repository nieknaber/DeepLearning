First, I'd like to say I am disappointed to read PC game reviews on Amazon and find that half of them rate the game at 1 star because of the distribution system - in many cases by people who don't even own the game! It's quite sad, since alternatives would be to play severely dumbed-down console games (I am talking about strategy games).  This game requires a high-end PC to run smoothly. With 8 gigs of RAM it takes a couple of minutes to start the game and just under a minute to switch from campaign map to battlefield - not terrible but definitely noticeable. Graphics are beautiful - which is a waste since you typically don't have time to watch individual soldiers fight.  Overall gameplay has not dramatically changed since the previous games in the series - yet it became more refined. For example, there are only 2 religions and 5 trade nodes (each can be reached in a few moves); trade and religion remain important but they don't overwhelm and let you concentrate on conquest rather than tedious management.  AI is, let's say, unpredictable. It is capable of really good and bad moves, both on campaign and battlefield maps. If you are not careful it is capable of giving you a beating even on easy difficulty. AI does use agents such as ninjas and priests with pretty good efficiency.  Overall, this is my close second-favorite game in the series after Rome. My only complaint is that the turns sometime drag out - it can be late at night and your only choice could be facing 5 long defensive battles for over an hour or autoresolve them and loose some key provinces.
