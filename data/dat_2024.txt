Played the beta, it's just not as good as I was wanting it to be. Its good for a free game, and the events are cool....but to be honest, i've been doing them in rift for over a year now. It has a serious \\"been there, done that\\" feel to it. Its not the revolution people are hoping it will be. Its a good game...but honestly, there are a LOT of good mmo's out there right now, and guild wars doesnt rise above. Combat is fun...but its just push button with a barrel roll. I think the game will suffer by the hype train. It isnt on par with wow's polish....and just like ToR, it'll get hammered because of it.
