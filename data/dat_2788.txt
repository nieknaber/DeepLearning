Well, this isn't Angry Birds, people. If you played GalCiv, Sins of a Solar Empire, Homeworld, Masters of Orion, or other similar games, this might be up your alley.<br /><br />This is a 4X game that lets you try pretty much anything. Want to build a starbase as big as a solar system? Yeah, you can do that. Want to tweak the automation rules for your planet governors? Not too tricky.<br /><br />There's a pretty steep learning curve, and the documentation isn't really written for beginners. A lot of things are trial and error; I tried building a massive Deathbringer ship, and it ran out of fuel just as it hit the enemy system. So I had to adjust. You'll get a feel for ship design and a sense for how quickly to build to keep from exhausting your resources. So yes, steep learning curve, but rewarding in the end. Start slow, ramp up.<br /><br />And check out some of the excellent mods; they can change up the gameplay in very interesting ways.<br /><br />If you invest a little time learning the ropes, and you have the temperament for 4X space games, this is a great addition to the library.
