This is a really fun game to play.  I got it specifically since it was on sale for $7.49 on December 24, 2012.  I couldn't pass up such a great price for a fairly new game.<br /><br />I think this game is more fun when you play with your friends around the computer and everyone gives ideas on how to solve the problem.  Because playing by yourself is fun... but not as much fun as when you are playing with another person and laughing at the silly things in the game.<br /><br />I don't think I would have bought this for $29.99, but it's just because I don't like spending much on game and instead like to wait for sales.  I would rather wait a year and save 75%, than have the game right away.  It will still be the same game a year later.
