I have several other games in this category and this one is the lowest on my \\"Liked Games\\" list.The story line and the graphics are good,but It's just a little too boring and it gets kinda confusing in spots. It's a decent game to play if you absolutely do not have anything else to do, but I would try to do something else instead.
