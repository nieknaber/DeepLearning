I was excited to show this to my daughter.  And it IS an awesome game... on xbox..  But definitely not recommended for mac osx yosemite.  We couldn't get several functions (like the one to &#34;interact) to work in the game. I even purchased a mouse- thinking it might be the fault of the trackpad on the laptop that the game was unplayable.  But the mouse didn't improve anything.  After searching forums fruitlessly, we have given up on playing this game.
