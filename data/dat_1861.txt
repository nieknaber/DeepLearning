This is an odd sort of game. There are a dozen or so levels, and each level plays as its own game; there is no carryover from previous levels. Some levels play in minutes while others can take an hour or so. Each level presents a set of tasks, and once you fill those it presents another set of tasks. For the most part, it does not tell you in advance what your ultimate goal is, so until you play a level a few times you're not quite sure where you're going with your farm.     You grow crops and buy animals, but you don't get to manufacture product like you do in Ranch Rush, just harvest it. I miss making bread and jam, but other than that, I enjoy this game and I do play a level or two fairly regularly. I also think the graphics are too large; even a simple farm does not fit on the screen and you have to scroll around a LOT to get anywhere. That doesn't take away from the game play much, though.    I wouldn't call Farm Craft addictive, but it is certainly the kind of thing you can play over and over again. In fact, this is one of the few games that becomes even more fun with repetition, when the challenge becomes doing things more efficently and shaving time off of previous attempts. And even though I really enjoy it, I don't think it's for everybody. If you liked Ranch Rush, you will probably like this too, but probably not as much.
