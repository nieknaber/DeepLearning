It was very good and made it feel like a whole new game! The only problem was, it wasn't. It did not really add anything new other than a small new town and a few vampires and a pretty cool celebrity system where you become more famous. And it really didn't work when you where in other towns, because things that would make you famous in the REAL world (becoming a well known writer, singer, etc.) Wouldn't make you famous. But sometimes it did not make sense at all. Other sims around you would not gain celebrity points, which made the game slow down a great deal. All i am saying is, it could have been fixed. But we all know EA, and if it could have, it WOULD have.  All in all, it's a good expansion pack, and i say you should get it.
