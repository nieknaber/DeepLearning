The first reviewer has already done a fine job explaining the premise of the game, so I'll refrain from rehashing.   I'll just discuss the various characteristics that make this a fun hidden-object game.      Artwork is quirky, very nicely detailed, and charming.   Think of a Victorian almost steampunk type world, except without any gothy darkness.  Objects are clear and one doesn't need to have X-ray vision to find the objects, although one does need to be observant.      Game length is medium, not too long, not too short.    Nice balance between finding objects and puzzles/problem-solving.  Puzzle difficulty ranges from easy to medium, with most of the puzzles being \\"easy\\" but not insultingly so.  The hint-meter is unlimited, you merely have to wait for it to refresh.  It refreshes at a normal rate, one doesn't have to run off to read a book waiting for it to replenish.    Music is a plus, for those of you who've seen that British TV series, Jeeves & Wooster-- the music is somewhat like the opening credits of that series.  (It has that bouncy, jaunty kind of flair you'd expect from quite a different period, the 1920s and 1930s.)    The end of the game clearly sets up a sequel, and if the sequel is at the same level of quality as this game, then I'm really looking forward to it!
