Positives: This extra piece of Human Revolution adds a very interesting layer to the story and fixes some problems from the main game.  The element of choice is much more prevalent in this episode, and towards the end, you are forced to make a very uncomfortable choice.  The last boss fight is an example of how the bosses should have played out in the main game.  The way I interpreted it, the end of Missing Link teases you with hints that more Deus ex might be in the future.  Negatives: Because this episode is self-contained, it does not fix any of the content and story-related problems found in the main game, and therefore, it does not allow the good elements of Missing Link to transfer over into the main game.  Because the whole mission is carried out in enemy territory, you won't be able to find any deep conversations or long side-quests to get into.  Technically, there are no substantial improvements or fixes in enemy AI or graphical glitches.  Missing Link is non-essential to the main game, but it provides the satisfying experience you would want out of a Deus ex game.
