When your boss says to you \\"You have potential, kid\\", what he really says is that maybe, in time, you will be a star, but right now you suck.<br /><br />This game is not bad, but it is not a finished product - it is a kind of a brilliant term paper project with SO many essential pieces missing or badly implemented that it almost becomes nonsensical. However, keep in mind that there are only two guys responsible for the entire game, so sincere KUDOS to them. Yet, sentiment aside, evaluating the game solely on its merits and flaws, it is a 2-star game. Explanations follow.<br /><br />== See the list of missing or poorly implemented features at the end of the review ==<br /><br />INTRO:<br /><br />FTL is not a game completely without merit (hence 2 stars instead of 1). It has potential. It is a decent idea and some of it is good, but overall, in spite of having potential (see?), this game isn't worth a dime (unless you enjoy endlessly replaying games which you are unable to finish). By the way, you can get FTL on GOG for 4 bucks if you wait a bit for another sale (like I did) and it will be Steam DRM-free.<br /><br />The 'addictive' nature of this game so many mention in their reviews comes from the developer's understanding of elementary human psychology 101: You crave what you can't have. And in this game what you can't have is victory. It is a carrot on a stick trick where the juicy carrot dangles so very close to you that you can almost taste it, but no matter how much you crave it and drool you just can't quite reach it, but you keep trying...<br /><br />Just look around on the web for user reviews. Even those who rate it highly admit that you will likely fail to beat the game (even if you can get to the Last Stand mission in one piece in the first place). You WILL fail to complete your mission and finish the game 27 out of 30 playthroughs on the easiest difficulty. I can confirm that. Having played it 31 times on Easy I managed to complete it only three times... and I promise you - when I did manage to finish the game it was NOT because I learned the game and got good at it. It was simple blind luck of the (card) draw. My first victory came on the third play-through. The next one came around the 15th attempt; and the third time I was victorious was around attempt 22 or thereabouts. The rest of the time I lost NOT because I was bad (come on, I beat it on the third try initially, right?) but because I could not get what I needed to win. In one play-through I could not find ANY weapon upgrades (except for a powerful missile launcher) in ANY stores at all. My original lasers + this weapon launcher were enough to fight my way to the final boss, but the three lasers simply cannot get through the boss ship's shields fast enough and its defense drones can easily shoot down your missiles rendering the missile launcher mostly useless.. so you end up in this situation simply because you could not buy the necessary upgrades.<br /><br />Here's why I give this game only 2 stars:<br /><br />---------<br /><br />Firstly, you are Flying Blind: You are on the run from the rebel fleet to deliver some vital information to the Federation fleet... and you only know the general direction you need to fly in (from the left to the right of the sector map). Mind you, you are not USS Voyager lost in the Delta quadrant knowing nothing about the space there. Instead, you are a Federation ship flying through mostly well-explored and well-charted Federation space (save for a few uncharted nebulae); yet you have NO idea where the Star Bases are (called Stores in FTL) where you can repair and resupply (well, there's only one Star Base in the game and it is not usable at all; the stores are some traveling merchants or black market outlets). And even if you install the Long-Range Scanner augment you can still only see a couple of jump points ahead. So you have zero ability to plan your flight path intelligently (Astrometrics lab anyone?). Each sector and theentire universe is always randomly generated (which is a good thing, actually) but your absolute inability to navigate through it intelligently is frustrating.<br /><br />Granted, sometimes you get help, like once I was 'invited' aboard a friendly ship and spied a detailed sector map. Another play-through I bumped (by accident) into THREE mercenary ships who sold me detailed sector maps... but during most play-throughs I did not get ANY of that kind of help and was, essentially, flying blindly and randomly. Give you a couple of examples of why this is bad:<br /><br />1. Say, you have a ton of scrap (used to purchase weapons and equipment and to upgrade your ship) - you've been saving it for a shopping spree - but you have no way to spend it because you don't know where the Stores are. Say, at some point a store lights up on your map but you can't get to it (for whatever reason). Or two stores light up... but you have no way of contacting them to see what they have for sale...(subspace communications anyone?) and you can't get to both of the stores... So you must, again, pick a Store at random and HOPE that they have what you need.<br /><br />Or you ARE able to get to both stores so you go to Store 1, see something decent there and you buy it. You buy it for fear that Store 2 may not have anything usable and you won't be able to return to Store 1 because the rebel fleet will be already there by the time you return... then you go to Store 2 and they actually DO have what you really, really need/want, but you have not enough scrap to buy it (since you had already spent it in Store 1). So this is 'game over' most of the time because if you don't find what you need to win further on in the game, well, you can't win.<br /><br />2. Completing achievements (and consequently unlocking new ships and things) also suffers from Flying Blind. Here's what happened with me during my last playthrough (which broke the camel's back and prompted me to write this review): I was playing with the Stealth Cruiser and going for the achievement where you reach the final sector (Sector 8) without having flown through a single hazardous area of space (such as asteroid belts). Guess what? It wasn't easy but I managed to avoid all hazardous areas until I jumped to Sector 7. Once there, I had only two jump points available to me and BOTH lead into asteroid belts (so much for the achievement and the Long Range Scanner which is installed on the Stealth Cruiser by default). Achievements should be achievable through careful and intelligent actions by the player. If achieving something (or failing to achieve it) is randomly dictated and set up by the game and the player has NO say in it whatsoever, these outcomes CANNOT and SHOULD NOT be called achievements. They should be called \\"blind luck accidental outcomes\\" or something like that. You will unlock achievements (accidentally). Good friggin' luck unlocking them intentionally.<br /><br />But it gets worse. Though I was lucky to have found (and equipped) top of the line weapons (two Burst Laser Mark III - yay!) this time around and no ship could stand up to me, when I finally engaged the final boss all of my weapons miraculously missed... TWICE in a row completely wasting my Cloak. So I took a lot of damage, Cloak and Shields destroyed, without doing any damage to the boss ship and I lost... for the 27th time...<br /><br />This game is NOT difficult or challenging. It is a completely unfair and random draw of cards where the House (almost) always wins. FTL is an ultimate exercise in futile and unsatisfying waste of time. Again, your success or failure does not depend on what you do. It depends on what cards you are dealt by the computer completely at random. Of course, you can make mistakes and lose because of that, but most of the time you will still lose even if you don't make any mistakes at all.<br /><br />---------<br /><br />Secondly, the replay value is only there for as long as you think you can get better at the game; as long as you think there's something you don't understand or not doing right. Once you realize that you are guaranteed to lose if you fail to GUESS correctly what to upgrade *now* and what you will be able to upgrade *later*, you realize that the replay value is a mirage. Certain systems and weapons work well with other systems and weapons but others don't. So if X works well with Y but not with Z and you upgrade X but never get Y you are guaranteed to lose the game. For example, if you buy and equip the Fire Beam or the Pike Beam you need to install a reliable means of destroying enemy shields. Otherwise the above weapons are useless. So if you don't find such means you are screwed.<br /><br />Now, you cannot hoard the scrap indefinitely because you cannot get too far without upgrades; so if you find nothing worth buying in the first few Stores and the enemies get progressively harder, you have to spend some scrap on systems' upgrades (such as Shields or Cloak) just to stay alive *right now*. Once you get to a store where you can buy an upgrade for a weapon (or a new weapon), etc. you kind of have to get it, hoping that other useful things will become available later, but they may not... or they will but you won't have enough scrap to buy them...<br /><br />Upgrading everything requires systems upgrades and reactor power upgrades. ALL upgrades cost A LOT of scrap. Since your options are always severely limited and your inventory is VERY, VERY small you have to do the best you can with what you've got at the moment and sometimes you have to sell decent weapons because you are SO far away from being able to use them that it is best to get/upgrade something else. So you end up getting rid of things that *may* come in handy later just to be able to survive *right now*... if you don't - it is 'game over' at the next jump point (beacon).<br /><br />In the game I mentioned above (where I was unable to get any usable weapon upgrades) I was so badly damaged at one point that I knew if I did not upgrade the engines, shields and cloak I would not survive the next engagement regardless of the power of my weapons and that I would never get a chance to reach a Store to repair and resupply, so I had to spend the scrap on the systems upgrades. And, sure enough, I made it to the Store and they had good stuff but I had no scrap to buy it... The rest of the stores I encountered either had NO weapons at all or they had the wrong weapons.<br /><br />The bottom line is that I ended up in the final (boss) battle with tons of shields, cloak and engine power and other systems upgrades but inadequate firepower to take down the boss ship. Similar scenarios unfold in 90% of the replays you attempt.<br /><br />---------<br /><br />Thirdly, combat is actually BORING. Yes, I've said it. Once you figure out two simple things (which should not take long) it becomes repetitive and boring:<br /><br />1. When fighting other ships you may think you should get creative and target various systems like shields, life support, engines, etc. But you should not. If you have decent firepower you should always target enemy weapons. If their weapons are damaged or disabled they cannot shoot at you. Just keep firing at their weapons control and eventually you will win. If you don't have the ability to take down their weapons, you can't take down ANY system on their ship and you don't stand a chance.<br /><br />2. When fighting enemy boarding parties all you need to do is move your entire crew into the medical bay and if your crew is large to the room right next to the med bay. Then open all hatches and doors to vent the air out of the ship (except the doors in the med bay and the room next to it, of course). The enemies, not wanting to suffocate, will abandon their plans to damage or destroy your systems and they will run to the med bay. Your crew in the med bay are healed automatically as they take damage, so they can kill an infinite number of enemies.Of course, if your med bay is destroyed or damaged or you are unable to power it this will not work, but then nothing will - enemy boarding parties are always a lot stronger than your guys. Even if you fight off the intruders without the healing of the med bay you will lose at least half of your crew and this is 'game over' as there is no recovering from this kind of loss.<br /><br />VERDICT:<br /><br />I'd say get FTL 2 if it ever comes out and if it is more balanced, more reasonable and a little more of a sandbox where you can actually apply some tactical and strategic thinking. In this game you can't.<br /><br />---------<br /><br />LIST OF MISSING (OR POORLY IMPLEMENTED) FEATURES (as I see it)<br /><br />- Inability to take deliberate steps to acquire sector navigation information (you only get it accidentally, if at all).<br /><br />- Inability to communicate with Stores/bases or other ships (you can 'hail' other ships ONLY in scripted events, not of your own volition).<br /><br />- TINY storage bays (inventory) on ships.<br /><br />- TINY augmentation capacity. You have space for only three augmentations. Okay. Fine. But if they give room for only three, you should be able to store unused augmentations in the inventory. For example, Long Range Scanner is only useful before you reach sector 8. You have NO use for it whatsoever during the Last Stand mission. You should be able to remove it and install something useful, like Automated Reloader (reduces weapons cooldown by 15%) before going into the final battle.<br /><br />- Inability to sell missiles or drone parts (if you are finding only beam and laser weapons and have no use for missiles, you should be able to sell them at Stores; right now you CAN sell missiles and drone parts or exchange them for fuel or the other way around but only in random places which you may or may not bump into).<br /><br />- Inability to buy back sold items - sometimes your arithmetic may falter and you realize you should not have sold 'that' weapon. You should be able to buy it back.<br /><br />- Game is programmed so that no matter how hard you try you cannot get certain augments for certain ships. For example, I have never seen a Cloak Generator available in any stores when playing with The Osprey ship. Everything should be installable on ANY ship.<br /><br />- You should be able to assess the probability of succeeding or failing in resolving random events. Right now random events can randomly have positive or negative outcomes and nothing depends on you at all.<br /><br />- You should be able to decide which members of your crew go on away missions; I don't want to send my fully trained helmsman or weapons officer on a dangerous away mission as losing either of them closer to the end game will cause you to lose (as the untrained weapons officer will be unable to hit the boss ship, for example).<br /><br />- Uncharted nebulae, while full of various hazards, should provide a means of evading the rebel fleet. However, EVERY SINGLE uncharted nebula says something like \\"The rebel fleet was prepared for this nebula, so it won't provide a good hiding place\\". This makes uncharted nebulae useless (you just avoid them), reducing tactical/strategic opportunities.<br /><br />- There should be fewer hostile ships and more friendly ships. Right now 9 out of 10 ships you encounter are hostile, even among the Federation members - nearly every frigging Zoltan, Mantis, Slug, Rock or Engi ship is a frigging pirate or slave trader or just 'ignores' your hails (as in you are not really hailing anyone, you just get a message like 'a ship is coming in, weapons hot, they are refusing all hails...').<br /><br />- You should be able to control your Boarding (attack) and Antipersonnel (defense) drones. Right now they attack randomly and you have zero control over them. If there are two enemy boarding parties on your ship you want to send the drone to attack the more dangerous one while your crew deal with the less dangerous party. If you launch your boarding drone at the enemy ship you want it to attack the system which you need damaged or destroyed to give you some advantage, not a random room with random equipment. You aim your weapons. Right? Why can't you program the drone to do something you want instead of doing something completely at random?<br /><br />- The same goes for System Repair drones which will repair damaged ship systems at random. If my weapons are damaged I want THAT repaired ASAP as the damaged Sensors can wait (especially in a nebula where sensors are inoperable).<br /><br />- The same goes for Defense and Anti-ship drones. If I want my defense drone to focus on shooting down incoming missiles and ignore incoming laser bursts (say I have enough shields to absorb the laser fire) I should be able to do just that. If I want the Anti-ship drones to focus on enemy shield generator, that's what I should be able to program them with. The ship system is called Drone Control after all, so you should be able to control them drones...<br /><br />- You should be able to resupply at the Federation Star Base in Sector 8 and potentially sell off obsolete equipment and get some weapons and systems there (it is a friggin' Star Base for Christ's sake, not some traveling merchant). Right now the base won't even repair your hull to full health if you are very badly damaged when you arrive there (it looks like they will only repair about 15 points of hull damage before sending you after the boss ship).<br /><br />- OUT OF FUEL! You can sit and wait for a passing ship to trade with or you can send out a distress signal which may attract enemies. This is COOL! BUT... when an automated refueling ship arrives it offers one unit of emergency fuel for free or more fuel at premium prices (in scrap). This is also COOL! What's NOT cool is that while you are sitting in space out of fuel you cannot see ANYTHING on the sector map aside from the huge NO FUEL sign. How many a time I had to buy lots of fuel expending oh-so-valuable scrap just to find out, once refueled, that there is a Store only one jump (one unit of fuel which I could get for free) away and that I could, in fact, save a ton of scrap by purchasing fuel at the Store... What? OUT OF FUEL means your scanners are not working? Does not make sense...<br /><br />- Hull damage/No hull damage... There are weapons in the game (such as Small Bomb) which are teleported onto a ship, attach themselves to a targeted system and do damage to the system and the personnel in that room, but they do NO hull damage. At the same time, when enemy boarding parties damage or destroy a system on your ship, the ship DOES take hull damage. This makes no sense.<br /><br />- By the way, enemy boarding parties are ALWAYS a lot stronger than your best trained security forces<br /><br />- Speaking about teleporting/boarding - the fact that teleporting is possible while the shields are UP goes against all Sci-Fi lore (such as Star Trek, etc.) I am sure you know that the patterns of teleported items/individuals are scrambled by energy shields (at least in all the Sci-Fi we know and there are pseudo scientific reasons for that). Why this is ignored in this game is beyond me... Makes no sense for a Federation starship captain if you ask me...<br /><br />The list of nonsense really goes on. Like I said earlier, this game has potential, but so many things are missing or poorly implemented that it is hard to recommend this game to anyone who wants to think and act like a Starship captain with a tactical and strategic brain in their skull.<br /><br />I sincerely hope that FTL 2 will address all of the above and more. Then it will be a 10/10 game, but right now it is a video game designer's college term paper, nothing more.d at one point that I knew if I did not upgrade the engines, shields and cloak I would not survive the next engagement regardless of the power of my weapons and that I would never get a chance to reach a Store to repair and resupply, so I had to spend the scrap on the systems upgrades.
