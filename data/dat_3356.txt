While I was able to play and enjoy the game especially its various expansions, I was not able to successfully install the game from the download. According to my installer, a particular program was missing. Just to give you an idea of my computer's specifications, I have an i7 graphics card, Windows 8 OS, 8 GB memory, 450 GB storage, etc -- all extant programs are optimized and updated to their latest versions.  And when I attempted to triangulate and activate the program, the game still would not complete its installation.<br /><br />I instead bought the disk version of Medieval II: Total War - Gold Edition, and everything worked well. I'm unsure if others have run into a similar problem with the downloadable version.
