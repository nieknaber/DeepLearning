I swore after getting screwed by LA Noire that I would never buy another cheesy Rockstar port. I should have checked more carefully because this game crashes when I load it. I can't even get past the splash page. I'm running on a 2nd gen i7 quad core on Windows 7 64 bit SP1 with 8Gb memory - GeForce GT550M.<br /><br />I found out how to get partially around the problem.<br />In Steam right-click on the Max Payne entry in your Library and select Properties<br />Click on [Set Launch Options] and enter \\"-safemode -windowed\\".<br />You can now run the game in windows mode. This should let you specify the graphics options. Once they are what you need, undo your launch options.<br /><br />Now I remember Rockstar won't let you play your own games until you give them your email address.<br />I hate Rockstar.
