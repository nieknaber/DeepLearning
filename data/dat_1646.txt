The company that created this game really doesn't care about it's customers. It is a real slap in the face for someone to buy the game and have an addition created shortly after that. Especially since this one has lot's of bugs in it. They should have just created a patch, but instead they wanted more money. It is close to impossible to get a hold of the company. It is fun, but after a time or two you move on to other better games. I wouldn't have bought this game if I knew all this ahead of time. Unless this drops to under $5, it is not worth it. It is also a huge resource user. I have a top of the line computer and it overheats my computer.
