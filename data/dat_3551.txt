I don't usually write reviews of my purchases but this time I am more than just a little bit motivated because I'm angry. I have never purchased a game through downloading before but I expected to just download it to my computer and have it run as though it came originally installed on my computer. I downloaded it at work so I could play it while I ate lunch.<br />There was no indication when I purchased it (unless I missed it in all of the fine print) that I was actually purchasing the game through a third party supplier called Origin. Once the game was downloaded to my computer, I found that I had to create an account with Origin. I found that I could not create the Origin account because my company's firewall prevented it so, no installation at work.<br />Next I downloaded it to my home computer and once again I had to create an Origin account which I now accomplished. Now that all of this was finished, I attempted to install the game and the Origin panel came up asking me to log in. After logging in, another panel came up instructing me to install the game through Origin. FAIL! I have repeatedly tried to install this game which can only be accomplished through Origin and each and every time it failed giving me some obscure error code.<br />For the very same price, I went over to Staples and bought the program. Now I can install it and play it wherever and whenever I wish.
