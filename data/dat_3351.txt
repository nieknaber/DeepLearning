I bought this game on day one and have had trouble with crashes (both the game and my computers), freezes, boredom (when it actually worked for a little while), etc. But I loved Civilizations III and IV and held off on my review until I gave it time to be fixed. Well, considering how long it has been since this game came out, I've given it plenty of time to work and it still doesn't. I've gotten as far as maybe 20 turns on two different, high speed computers, on maybe three separate occasions. Now I'm left with no other option than to uninstall it from my computers as it just takes up space for no good reason.<br /><br />Judging by the REAL reviews I've read, I'm not alone; although the overall rating for this game is completely misleading because of all the fake reviews. Don't fall for the high rating reviews and don't write off the low rating reviews either. I'm sorry, but someone has to either be the lone exception to the majority at best, or paid to give this game anything other than a bad rating. Even Game Informer gave it high ratings when they \\"tested\\" it but once it was released admitted it was full of flaws and problems. IT DOESN'T WORK! How can you rate anything above a total failure, no matter your love of the series, if it DOESN'T WORK? I gave it time to be fixed, for the creators to correct their errors and they have completely failed me (and many of us). Don't take my word for how bad this is but don't take the word of these \\"high\\" ratings either. Read the \\"high rating\\" reviews and you'll notice patterns, repetition, and similar statements. Even some mention the crashes and multiple other issues but still rate it high. Stick with III and IV and hope that if there is a VI it will make us forget there was ever a Civilization V.
