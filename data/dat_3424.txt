I don't even need to restate why this game is a disappointment - any one of the thousands of other negative reviews surely covers any points I could make. It really makes me sad to see the SimCity franchise so utterly disgraced by EA. I've been a fan of Maxis for as long as I can remember. I played the original SimCity for PC (and every single subsequent release), and even their more obscure games like SimEarth and even Widget Workshop. But this game... it simply doesn't do the studio justice. I know this isn't what they intended. The development of this game was tainted by the higher-ups at Electronic Arts. The always-online DRM, the inevitable release of hundreds of add-ons and expansions containing content that was purposely left out of the game so they could charge for it later, the forced multiplayer of a textbook single player game. It's absolutely horrible.<br /><br />Shame on you EA. I didn't like you before, but this is the last straw. I will NEVER buy another game from EA, and I've recommended that none of my friends or family do so either. I hope to play this game in the future, but I can promise that I won't be paying for it. If anything, I'll send some money to Maxis studios. It certainly won't be lining EA's pockets.
