Second time i tried downloading this game and installing it it ran just fine, and old arma 2 players will have very little trouble going from arma 2 to this. Having said that this is  the second time i downloaded it so there is room for improvement. For me the game runs just as well as arma 2 the textures could use a little tweaking but overall it is an ok game.
