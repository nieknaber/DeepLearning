PC version, bought on Steam. All DLC from the original game carried over, had to purchase a DLC pass to bring over the songs that came with the original game (the core songs, not DLC).<br /><br />As D. Hewitt points out, you'll want to use your motherboard's onboard sound to reduce latency, this was necessary in the original version as well. But in the original, even doing that and changing .ini files, tweaking settings, there was still a lot of latency if you're a guitarist. I've been playing for 30 years and trying to play a Megadeth solo with latency isn't happening.<br /><br />The good news is: Rocksmith 2014 is almost completely free of the latency plaguing the original. Tons of interface tweaks so it's easier to jump in and do what you want, load times reduced, a massively improved riff repeater mode, score attack leaderboards, the list is quite extensive.<br /><br />Weekly DLC releases on Tuesday, this week was an Iron Maiden songpack with 5 songs. Playing Harris bass lines, yes please.<br /><br />Bottom line, with this game and a lot of hard (but fun) work, you can learn to play guitar or bass. If you already know how to play, you'll pick up a few new songs and have a nice backing track setup, the leaderboards are fun.<br /><br />Personal wish: I wish they'd put the actual fret number on the little colored boxes. They did add a highlighted number under some of the boxes, which is a huge improvement over the original game where it was too easy to get lost on the fretboard as the move it around. Just having an advanced option for tab sight-readers would basically make this game perfect.
