I guess this should be based on each individuals PC, but even with lag correction my PC had trouble accepting what notes I was playing. Often times it would say I hit no note, but even the in-game amp would sound off in the background. The tuner also was an issue, as it would give me a +0 (indicating it was correctly tuned) and then flip between +1 and -1 telling me quickly that I needed to both tighten and loosen my string. You mean.. it's in tune? I spent more time trying to get the game to accept my instrument as tuned as practicing it seemed.<br /><br />For reflection, I also purchased the Xbox 360 version on black Friday. That version operates phenomenally and these issues only seem to be on the Steam download version. Until a patch comes through, it's Xbox 360 only for me.
