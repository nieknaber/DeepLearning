I've played many games of this sort, and I think this is one of the best. It's unique, long and not as formulaic as some games of this genre. The graphics are great and I even found myself enjoying the music! It's not the same track that most of these games use.<br /><br />It took me a little bit to get into this game, but once I did it was great!
