So lets release a game, charge for it but no one can actually play it for any significant amount of time.  No one should be selling this game.  It crashes randomly constantly.  Sometimes you can play for 5 minutes other times 30.  Every time i've played, the game becomes unusable.  They should be ashamed of themselves for selling such a terrible product. This is honestly the worst built software i have EVER used.  Hands down.  If you don't beleive me, look at their support forums.  It is full of un-answered issues.  Please safe your self the money and buy anything but this.  Honestly, i question if i'll ever buy a game from those scammers again.<br />Just as a reference, i have a solid state drive, 16gb of ram, 8 core zambezi proc and a NVIDIA graphics card.  If this can't run the game then nothing can.
