This was a really great game. Very similar to Red Dead Redemption, but just a little shorter. It is a bummer there is no multiplayer. A great story, voice acting, and graphics come together for a great ride. Maybe not worth $50-$60 for console players, but if you can get this for $20 or less, get it.
