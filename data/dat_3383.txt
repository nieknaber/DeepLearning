This game perhaps should be retitled Rocket Mail or Cheetah Mail. It is fast, furious, and fun. As your snail picks up and carries the mail obstacles come up in the various lanes as the snail zips through space. I love this game. And I'm rotten at it! I rarely get very far into the levels, but have a great deal of fun playing the game. And oh yes, if your stomach is weak, it will be bouncing up and down with the Snail as he hits the hills and vales!
