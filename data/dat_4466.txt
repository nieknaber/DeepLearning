Alan Wake's American Nightmare is not Alan Wake II. If that's what you're expecting, you will be disappointed. No whether it's as GOOD as Alan Wake, that's hard to say because American Nightmare is a really different game. It maintains and expands on the story narrative from the original game and the 2 DLC episodes of \\"The Signal\\" and \\"The Writer\\". The mechanics are basically the same, although I would say even refined a bit--Alan is definitely less of a spaz to control in this one. That was a big plus for me, because I'm a spaz enough as it is without having to worry about Alan running off a cliff because I couldn't get him to jump the right way.<br /><br />The atmosphere and mood is still suspenseful, but much more campy than the first due to the nature of the setting. You basically play out an episode of \\"Night Springs,\\" a cheesy Twilight Zone knock-off in-universeTV show that Alan explains he used to write for. Alan battles against his doppelganger, a truly creepy antagonist named Mr. Scratch whom Alan met at the end of the original Alan Wake game. Mr. Scratch has figured out how to cross over into the Real World, and he's making things difficult for Alan...to say the least. Now Alan has to collect pages of his manuscript once again to try and beat Mr. Scratch at his own game.<br /><br />Ilkka Villi returns as the actor for Alan Wake and Mr. Scratch, whom we mostly see in live-action video clips. Matthew Poretta returns to provide Alan's / Scratchy's voice-overs, and the 2 actors are really dynamite together. You can tell everyone had fun with this one; you just don't get a chance to be THAT bad.<br /><br />I don't know if folks who didn't play the first Alan Wake will enjoy it as much. There are a LOT of in-game references and nods to the first. They sum up the story fairly well, but a newcomer might be a little lost. However, Ilkka Villi's creepy-awesome performance is worth the price, alone. There is an Arcade challenge mode where you have to survive for 10 minutes in different places of \\"Night Springs\\" against an army of Taken. I find it highly stressful, as I can barely avoid being clobbered for 10 minutes in the regular story mode, but it is kinda fun. Also you get a crossbow.<br /><br />The game is short. Think of it like a playable \\"novella\\" (to Alan Wake's \\"novel\\"). If you're looking to peek into the world of Alan Wake but you're not sure if you want to commit to the whole series, give it a shot. If you're already an Alan Wake fan, American Nightmare is mandatory. It's a little more satisfying of an ending, but by no means a resolution to Alan's whole story, so gives us a little something to hold on to until we meet up with Alan again. If you're STILL not sure, check out Mr. Scratch's \\"Super Effective Sales Pitch\\" on YouTube. That's sure to win ya over.inutes in different places of \\"Night Springs\\" against an army of Taken.
