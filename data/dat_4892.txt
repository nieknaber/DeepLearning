I'm biased.  There's a nostalgia factor involved here that simply cannot be impressed upon those who never played the board game.  This edition includes some of the more oddball races but it's still great fun.  Irreverent sports commentators, semi-adult jokes, just plain bad humor with some good mixed in?  Again, just great fun and tremendous replay value.
