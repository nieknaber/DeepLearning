Wow. Simply, wow. As I played this game, I couldn't help but to marvel at the ingenuity that went into carefully adding functionality to the features of the VITA. No other game so far has caught the essence of what the VITA could do (or should do). I mean, this gem makes use of both analog sticks, the digital pad, the touch screens -both front and back, the cameras -both fron and back, and the gyroscope. The guys at Media Molecule had shown us that they know how to make platformers with Little Big Planet, but Tearway has taking this concept to a new height. Plus, it doesn't hurt that the story is quite involving yet simple, and quite literally brings YOU into the game.<br /><br />Highly recommended!
