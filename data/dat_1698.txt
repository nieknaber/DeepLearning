Flower was a game more made for a child under 3 years old because you mindlessly push buttons to make the flower move around and it interacts with the landscaping. It's also good for a person who is tripping out on drugs and needs something to calm them down. 2/5 stars<br /><br />Trine 2 is like a mario style side scroller game with puzzle elements. The coolest thing about the game was the 3d aspect if you have a 3d capable tv it really does bring out those elements to life. 4/5 stars<br /><br />Super motherload is a game where you dig and mine for metal. It got quite annoying with getting minerals and running out of gas and constantly going back and forth. It has a leveling system but I couldn't really get into the game at all. 2/5
