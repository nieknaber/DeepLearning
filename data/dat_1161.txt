I actually own this on XBOX and bought the CD for PC a long time ago. The CD no longer installs so I bought the download version from Amazon. I keep coming back to this game. Like other reviewers, I installed some graphics mods. I wanted to see the photo realism people were talking about. With mods, it looks like a next gen game. The only problem is, it seems to crash a lot on Win 7 64bit even with no mods installed. I have reinstalled twice. I had to turn the graphics way down on a machine that should have no problem running this thing and I am still getting crashes in places on the map with large numbers of polygons. I have 8 gig ram and GTX 550 Ti graphics card. I run Battlefield 3 or Skyrim no prob. Maybe I'll get a new gfx card, but somehow I'm not convinced the solution to the crashes is not that simple.<br /><br />Edit: The game will no longer activate on Steam. I can no longer play it! One star for being BROKEN!
