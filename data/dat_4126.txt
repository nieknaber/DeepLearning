I bought this game last September, never had any problems with downloading or playing for that matter. But now all of a sudden (a year later), in the middle of playing it just closes out and whatever I did is gone. So I deleted all the files off the computer thinking I could re-download it, but its not letting me! So frustrated! I don't know what else to do! Help!
