These games are pretty good, and for a good price when you grab this on a sale.<br /><br />Bioshock is the spiritual successor to the System Shock games which were some of my favorite 'classic' games. They're a FPS game, but they are greatly different from the mainstream FPS games. Mainly in that they tell a story and have a pretty decent length single player experience. In fact, the first game is all single player with no multiplayer at all (as it should be). The story is that of a mystery. You find yourself escaping from a crashed plane in the middle of the ocean to find the entrance to Rapture, an underwater city independant from the two super powers (the setting is cold war era, so USA and USSR). The story unfolds as you try to determine what the heck is going on in this place that's mostly devoid of life.<br /><br />The games have some minor puzzles and some simple mini games (for example hacking a vending machine) to break up the gameplay. You can also upgrade your character through the use of plasmids (in System Shock these were implants).<br /><br />I don't want to say too much about the story really, because it is a mystery and it would spoil all the fun for you if I revealed too much about it.<br /><br />Overall I thought they were pretty fun games, but not as good as the original System Shock franchise. Of a minor note, the codes you get for this digital purchase does not work on Steam so you must download the game from Amazon and install it like you would a normal game. Amazon does have a steam version of this two pack if that is what you prefer.
