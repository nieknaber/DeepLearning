Wife is addicted to these games, I purchase all the expansions for her.  She loves them.  The install gets rather large though, which of course significantly adds time wise to anti virus scans.  Plus there is some load slowness issues that occur the more items/expansions that you add to the game.  But other than that its a fantastic game and I dont feel those items listed above warrant a 4 star review.
