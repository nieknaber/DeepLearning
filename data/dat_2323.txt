I bought this when it was on sale right before the F2P update. It's a purchase I don't really regret, and I still think it was totally worth it.<br />TERA is a (now F2P) action MMORPG game, that features one of the best combat systems I've seen in a MMO to date and the game has really beautiful graphics, however sadly, that's all it is. Questing (pretty much the only way to level) gets really boring after a while, as it is the same thing over and over again, the story is meh and the endgame seems to be your average dungeons and pretty costumes. The game has a decent community though.<br />All in all, I would recommend to try this game out, but don't expect quality you would receive from bigger titles such as GW2, WoW (simply because they have more money and bigger studios that work on the game) or whatever big title MMO is out there.
