My impressions about the campaign:<br /><br />The game is pure fun, with some epic battles, a very fluid gameplay, cutscenes always very well placed connecting the action to the story and giving a perfect feeling of progress, it is so addictive that at no time the player finds him/herself wishing for it to end, but rather the contrary, when you feel that the end is near the desire is to postpone it to the maximum. Quoting a line from the game itself, \\"not a dull moment\\".<br /><br />A wide variety of weapons, with one of the best assault and sniper rifles I've ever seen (the former delivers shots of great impact and realistic sounds when the clip is about to empty -- prompting the player to reload it even in the heat of the most frantic battle), and the latter with the amazing \\"heat signature\\" feature, detecting the body heat and very useful to trace back the attacks when you don't know where they are coming from.<br /><br />It even has one of the best, if not THE best weapon I've ever seen, called \\"Singularity Cannon\\".<br /><br />And of course, it's Red Faction, so you can also take advantage of the whole destructible scenario around you (well, almost) to aid you in your battles, and there are endless possibilities: the reward for using your imagination is second to none.<br /><br />The checkpoint system timing is amazing: perfectly placed, never penalizes nor frustrates the player (still, you can manually save your game), and the achievements progress is shown in the screen: they do no pop up out of the blue when you reach them, which is an incentive for the player to pursue them. If you like achievements like myself, believe me, this system adds A LOT to the fun.<br /><br />The controls are very smooth, the story is good enough to keep your interest from start to finish.<br /><br />But the whole package is just plain fun. Not a serious game like Mass Effect, maybe no replay value, but it delivers what a game is supposed to be about: entertainment and, again, fun.Got me hooked from start to finish.<br /><br />It's only sin is the FOV: it could be wider, it is so close that it lends the game a \\"cheap feeling\\". But don't be mistaken, everything is very well done.<br /><br />The DLC, on the other hand, is as dull as it can be, pointless, a mere slot machine wishing for your coins. It should be named \\"In search for more money\\". What a shame, because after playing half of the game I purchased it without a second thought.<br /><br />Word of advice, stay clear of the DLC. Its only positive point is that it is very short, thank heavens.<br /><br />The main game, this game, however... is just classic, solid fun!
