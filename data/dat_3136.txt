There are numerous technical glitches in the game - I got a failure at the Grand Canyon gift shop when I finally had to give up on a mini-game because I couldn't return an item.  I'm stuck in Area 51 now, as I'm supposed to give two pamphlets to the father, but he won't take them.  The help system is lousy and there is no walkthrough for the game as yet.  I noticed several comments on game sites from people who couldn't even get out of the house at the beginning.  Items are often tiny and sometimes completely hidden behind other things (and it's the last item in the list, so it's not like I need to find something first).  There is no hint that some items can't be found until the characters do something.  (In the mechanic's garage, you can't find several items on the list until he's done with the car.)  Some of the mini-games are ridiculously hard, and even in 'easy' mode, you have to wait 5 minutes to skip them.<br />Not recommended, especially for the current price (9.99).
