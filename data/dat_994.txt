The game is good out of the box, but the fun only lasted about three months before I experience everything that there is to experience. And that was playing extremely casually. The development team does not make any meaningful content whatsoever. For a game, from the outset, that claimed grinding was not a necessity counters that ideal if you want anything other than the hand-me-out welfare exotics. And if you decide to grind/farm, you're brutally punished for doing so with diminishing returns placed everywhere in the game. You'll likely at many points during your gameplay early on, find yourself at the mercy of simply not having enough in-game currency. Don't waste your real life money for gems to then convert to gold. Just learn and analyze the auction house and make your money trading/flipping items. If you purchase this title, don't give Arena Net any more money than the cost of the game. At least not until they start producing quality and meaningful content instead of mindless events that can be completed while watching a movie in the span of a lazy Sunday afternoon.
