This game has entirely different graphics- it takes place in a pop-up book.  Paige Harper finds herself trying to sort out problems in great books- literally.  Each story consists of several pop-up book scenes using elements of the story and setting.  The works range from Sherlock Holmes to Shakespeare, and navigating around these pop-up scenes offers some unique gameplay.  I found some of the objects to be near-impossible to find, but there are hints available.  This seems like it might be a love or hate sort of game.  I'd definitely recommend doing a trial play before buying.
