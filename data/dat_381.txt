I've played almost all of the Nancy Drew games since the beginning. This game was great! It felt very exciting and the plot of the game was absolutely phenomenal. One has to switch the time of day from day to night to talk to certain characters and although toward the middle of the game I was able to somewhat pinpoint who did it I was, but over all this was a great game and I can't wait for the next one.
