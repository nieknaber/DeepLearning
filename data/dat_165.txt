Others have commented on the features of this expansion pack, so I won't touch on that as much. Just know that this is, in my opinion, the best expansion pack yet for TS3! It adds so much realistic life aspects to the game while still being fun and entertaining. It's so jam packed with features it took several days of multi-hour playing to truly discover all of the new features, and I'm still enjoying it months later!<br />It's worth mentioning that I've also had the least bug/glitch issues with this expansion pack compared to the others. My game (even on a Mac) hasn't frozen or glitched at all since I installed this expansion pack. Very happy about that!<br /><br />Love this game!
