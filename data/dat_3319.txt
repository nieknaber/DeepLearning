I enjoyed this game a great deal, though I admit that the second time around I was able to breeze through every order and earn all the trophies. However, I still went back and played it again, so it must be doing something right.    I liked the variety of things to make and sell and the challenge of fitting everything into limited space. And it's always fun the first time you play a game like this to see what's coming next. It would be more of a challenge, I think, if you could choose what to upgrade next - speedy gloves, boots, machines etc - rather than having the upgrade being available at a given time. Also, if you are playing right you always have more than enough money to buy everything you need. You don't even have to play the Farmer's Market levels to get extra money; just use them to prepare for the next level. So maybe the money earning/spending part is too easy.    It is a little tough scrolling around to get to everything but you get used to it. A nice touch is the distinctive sound effects when the cows give milk, the bees make honey, etc, so you don't have to keep scrolling over to look.     The downside of the game is that there is not a lot of it; the customer orders don't vary on subsequent plays. So, the replay value is limited. Which is a real shame because this game is well designed and a pleasure to play. Well worth the money despite this limitation.
