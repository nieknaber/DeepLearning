Game uses the civ 5 engine, which is nice for more reasons than familiarity. No more outfitting each individual unit with each piece of new tech, instead when you accumulate affinity levels you have a chance to make a wholesale mod to all units of that type.<br />The first game you play will be mind blowing. The world is so alien, the tech \\"web\\" consuming. Within an hour of play your first settlement will be a mega city, your expansions pushing their borders into your neighbors, and your trade routes numbering in the hundreds (assuming you went prosperity and not military). I reached this point and still had no clue what I wanted to achieve.  Espionage can be used to commit atrocities, social policies will define your society, wars will be fought over ideology. Absolutely love it, many times replay able.<br />Do miss being able to raise a mountain to turn my neighbors breadbasket into a desert, but the orbital layer is a redeemer. 4.5 stars.
