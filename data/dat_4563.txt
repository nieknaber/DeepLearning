As many before have mentioned, do not download this game. I've tried several times to get it to download through the Amazon downloader just for it to crash at 85% complete. I've even tried going through EA's Origin downloader using the product key and kept getting errors there, too.    I was really excited to play this game and have all the content at my finger tips. Now, I've wasted several hours trying to get the stupid thing to work and am out about $25. Can't say whether or not the game is great because I can't play it. If you want to get this game, buy the hard copy. Downloading just isn't worth it.
