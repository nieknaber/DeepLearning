Fun to play when you want to take a break from the world.  I love changing the plants and accessories for different looks and I have 3 beautiful gardens in my computer.  The seek and finds are fun and it kinda keeps your brain sharp.  Fun for young and old...my grand children play it and so do I!  (and I'm no spring chicken!)
