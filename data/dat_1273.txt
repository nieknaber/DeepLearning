The Borderlands 2 Psycho Pack is a worthy addition to the game, an addition that I would heartily recommend, with one caveat. This character will mean (at least) one more trip through Borderlands 2's main campaign, which I had already completed four times by the time Krieg was released.<br /><br />Krieg himself is an excellent character. His melee focus changes up the gameplay style nicely and is a very viable playstyle for pretty much the entire game. It feels excellent to be able to take damage as freely as Krieg can and sinking your buzzsaw into enemies works pretty darn well for a melee weapon in a first-person game. Krieg's main downside(that is actually oriented specifically around his character) is that he makes the grind for guns less fun. You'd really rather be leveling up his various skills and getting cool bonuses that further change and upgrade his melee than getting the guns and other equipment that you will still need to progress through the game.<br /><br />So yeah, if you have either just bought Borderlands 2 or feel the need for a really different character to give it another go, give Krieg a try. Just don't expect him to give new life to a slog of a campaign.
