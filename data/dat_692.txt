The transaction went as smoothly as I could imagine. I received my 13 month card code in about 30 seconds, was able to print it, and I couldn't be happier. I saved 10 dollars, the card was on sale for $39. Not to mention, saved myself some time and gas not having to drive to the local shop to get one. I highly recommend the amazon online store for any future XBL purchases.
