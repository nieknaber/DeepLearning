I bought the game and after downloading it was able to play it without issues.  Then Steam started acting up and wont allow me to play the game in the offline mode.  I ahve attempted everything, to include re-downloading everything.  I dont always have internet and cannot play the game without Steam connecting to the net.  I tried customer support at Steam and found that it takes forever to get any response from them, and then all they do is refer you back to the web site.  STEAM SUCKS.
