My nephew originally talked me into trying out the first Darksiders while I was getting him to play Dark Souls some.  For a $15 download I figured what the heck and went with it.  It was a great game, but didn't really feel like it shined as much as the games it was pulling from.  The combat was fun and flashy like Devil May Cry, or God of War, but even on a higher difficulty it wasn't even close to normal difficulty on either of the games(nor was itself challenging despite the fun factor).  It had a decent amount of open world, but was fairly small compared to other games, and despite a good amount of side areas still didn't feel like there was a ton to explore.  The puzzles also weren't very engaging(except Black Throne portals/cages lol) when compared to Zelda style games.  Now enter Darksiders 2, the followup story to the events of Darksiders where you play as Death, the brother of the falsely accused War.<br /><br />Graphics:<br />Same art style as Darksiders, although the overall graphic quality seems a bit sharper I guess you could say.  I've yet to run into any graphical bugs/glitches so far, and I've not had any FPS drops even in heavy action.<br /><br />Gameplay(this'll be a big one):<br />Several things to note here, the mesh of genres it felt like they tried to do for Darksiders really shines through here.  Where everything was decent but not great in Darksiders, Darksiders 2 excels.  The flow of combat is much faster than Darksiders, and your attack patterns mesh together so well that I felt totally BA the first time I fought a monster.  It looks amazing, and you can link attacks together easily even with your alternate weapon.  However taking hits is a little less forgiving than Darksiders.  The finish(O/B) is back but it's not always active, it's more of a special thing that will pop up sometimes when you've been doing a nice combo without getting hit/interrupted.  More of a reward than something you see done over and over again throughout the entiregame.  Now the world, so far the world has been fairly massive as well.  I passed tons of side areas here and there just exploring on my way to the very first dungeon, I had to stop after about 45min of exploring and finding treasures because I wanted to see if I could get through the first dungeon before bedtime lol.  The environments are aesthetically pleasing as well.  On the note of exploring, traversal in Darksiders 2 is so much like Assassins Creed, only a little faster paced.  You can climb/jump on/interact with just about everything to a certain degree.  The puzzles in the dungeons so far as well have been far more engaging than Darksiders, still not quite Zelda level(so far anyways), but more fun nonetheless.  You also level up, get loot, and assign Skill Points like your run-of-the-mill RPG.  It gives you something to tinker with and build/customize while adventuring.<br /><br />Audio:<br />No complaints so far, the music has been epic, but not overdone.  The focus is the game after all, and the music really helps set the scenes instead of trying to fly solo.  The voice acting has been good so far as well, although the mouth movements sometimes don't match up to the audio very well.<br /><br />Over all an absolutely fantastic game so far and I can't wait to get home and play it some more.  My one standing complaint is the load time, the game seems to take a very long time to initially load up, although things are far smoother once you get into the game.  Worth mentioning, but not worth affecting the rating IMHO.
