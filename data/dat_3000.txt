I believe even a young child would enjoy this.  This can be addictive.  I will start a session and hours later I will still be playing especially in relax play.  I have had this game before but lose it when my hard drive needs to be rebooted.  I loved it so much that when I saw it for a very cheap price, I grabbed it again.
