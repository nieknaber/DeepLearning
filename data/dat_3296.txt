The game freezes up on me way too often for my liking. It freezes up and will not unfreeze unless I restart my PS3. To me, that is unacceptable. Would you pay $60 for a copy of this game if it froze up on you? If your answer is no, then please do not buy this version unless you really want to play it and it's your last option. I'm pretty sure the physical disc does not have this problem but I'll never know because I messed around and bought the Digital download hoping to have a good time with this game on my 2 PS3s. I'll never see Call Of Duty the same again. SMH.
