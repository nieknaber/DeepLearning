Well written, interesting story and strong atmosphere that are worth playing the game for.  Music and sound effects are also very good, and the main character (the only speaking part) is well voiced.  Gameplay has some problems though. Had a number of crashes, so save regularly.  Graphically, it's primitive.  Looks pretty much Diablo 1 even though it came out 10 years later, including lack of support for modern resolutions,  The story stalls a number of times where it's not clear what you need to do to get it going again.  There's some particular person generally you need to talk to to advance the plot at these points, so you can wander around talking to everyone again trying to find the right trigger, or, better yet, just keep a walkthrough handy.  The sword fights are terrible, though there's only about five or so of them.  Overall recommended even with these problems for the story and other positive elements.
