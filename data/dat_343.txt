I have had no problems with this DLC at all. I liked the challenges of the additional quests and story line. I started it around level 12 or so, and found the foes and battles to be slightly challenging, in a good way. I actually had my character face some challenging battles where outcome was determined at last minute. I like that in a game DLC, not a cakewalk and actually gives some more flesh to this game.
