This Little Shop game is as fun to play as the others I have bought. You can play these games in the relaxed mode which is a bit different than most relaxed mode games. This gives you a count down on time and if you run out of time, you can start it again or not. You are given stars: Gold, Silver, Bronze. You can take the first to come up if it isn't gold or try again for the gold. No demonic or violent scenes or objects to find. Great for the whole family. I have 4 or 5 of the games in this series and they are all safe.
