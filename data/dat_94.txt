Wow, this game is just an absolute masterpiece. Its gameplay is seemingly simple, yet truly is dynamic and will keep you interested for ages. This can be picked up by anyone and within 30 minutes they'll understand everything about the game.<br /><br />I find Stronghold to be one of the most relaxing games out there to play. Building your castle, improving your economy, and making an army are all essential to success, yet nothing seems too pressing as seen with other games. I've never thought much of a soundtrack in any video game, but this is an exception. The medieval soundtrack really helps to make it a truly tranquil experience, and puts you right back in the middle ages.<br /><br />Although not on par to today's standards in regard to graphics, I still feel that there is an element of beauty to the scenery. Green grass, waterfalls, wildlife, and of course a magnificent castle are all something to marvel at. It's just really fun, and great if you have some time to kick back. Only caveat I can think to say is to make sure to be aware of the time. There's been a few instances where I thought I'd just get a quick session in, but when I exit the game I'm shocked to learn that hours have flown by.<br /><br />With a price of $6, you can't go wrong. Stronghold has a lot to offer, and should keep you entertained for hours on end.
