Picked this up during a freebie promotion and it was a good choice.  Cartoon graphics and catchy (albeit repetitive) music surround a basic story of grandpa losing some important items in different rooms of a horribly messy home.  From there you're tasked with finding a list of items in various rooms which then unlocks a standard jigsaw puzzle (not sure how that fits in with the story).  Once you solve the jigsaw you are once again returned to the rooms you were in to find the one prominent item in the jigsaw puzzle.  Once it's found you're on to the next level.  There's another minigame called Scribbles hidden within.  As you find family photos, the young kids pop up and invite you to point out the different doodles they draw on the photo.  Find 15 or more without picking one you already chose and you'll get a gold star.  Get a gold star on all the photos and you'll be let in on an interesting secret of theirs.<br /><br />Unfortunately the following levels are more of the same so the game does get repetitive.  As you can gather, it's a hide-and-seek game like Where's Waldo or something to that effect.  It's also rather European in both the voice acting and the game's dry wit.  I also felt the developers took the easy route in later levels by hiding items behind other objects or giving them odd colors that would blend into a surrounding area rather than building the object into another as done in the early levels.  Fortunately you can enlist the services of the family pet, Scruffy, to help you find difficult items.  While I did complete the game in a few days, I was more or less doing it only so I could see the ending (wasn't disappointed).<br /><br />Rather than go it alone, it's actually more fun to invite others, especially kids, to help you find items and complete each level.  It's also non-violent and no naughty words so very young children can join in.  Massages the brain good too.  Recommended.
