I agree with previous reviewers in that this game is very addictive. It will also make you very hungry. The graphics are so realistic, I found myself having to fight off the urge to go out and grab a burger and fries each time I played it. Aside from that, I enjoyed every element of this game. The concept is somewhat typical of these types of games--fulfill the customer's order making it the way they want it before they get ticked off and leave. The game becomes very challenging; by the time you get to the end you're making hundreds of variations of the dishes to a variety of customers with different levels of patience. There is also a Hall of Fame which awards trophies for various accomplishments. This is one of my favorite parts of the game because I didn't feel like I was done with the game even when I had finished all of the levels. You want to keep going back and try to achieve that perfect status (which is almost impossible in some levels without using the space bar to pause the game and plan your next couple of moves). This game download is worth every penny.
