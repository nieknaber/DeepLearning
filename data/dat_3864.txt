I did manage to play this for 4 hours last night but tonight - second night after launch - all the servers are massively overloaded. Because the game requires an always-on connection to the EA Origin servers to play, when the servers go down, you don't play. And the servers have been down all day.<br />Plus : and this is a hidden \\"feature\\" (according to their PR) - your saved games are saved only on the server you're playing on - they don't sync between servers. So if you manage to play one night and that server is dead the next, all your work has gone.<br />The game itself is a huge 5 stars when it works. EA's Origin system for DRM and their appalling server infrastructure are why this got 1 star and why it's rating on Amazon has tanked.<br /><br />Update : day 3 : still no servers. They're all down, and still refusing connections.<br /><br />Update : day 4 : still no servers. Still all down / busy / refusing connections. EA claim they're working \\"24/7\\" to fix this issue but they're clearly not. They've taken everyone's money and delivered a piece of software that nobody can use. The server list is no different from what it was 2 days ago so the whole notion that they're \\"adding more\\" is a blatant lie. Fortunately Amazon are doing the right thing and refunding customers now - something EA refused to do. EA can burn in Hell for this disaster.
