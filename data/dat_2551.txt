Perhaps this game should be called 'Be Alexander the Great and Conquer the Known World'. During my Christmas break this year, I downloaded the game, opened it up, and created a character. Immediately, I was sucked in to the rich and varied cultures of Mount and Blade: Warband. If you are a history buff, an anthropologist, or just a medieval or renaissance enthusiast, you will oft find yourself starting the game and waking up hours later to wonder where the time went. Unfortunately, there is a huge learning curve, and since I knew that I wanted to conquer as much of Calradia as I could by the end of my two week break, I decided that my rather noviced character wasn't moving fast enough in terms of progression. Thus, I exported the character and proceeded to power it up far past anything that I would've done in the limited time I had. And so, Achilles was born. He has max attributes and a fortune in denars (in-game currency). And for the past couple days, his hordes of vicious, unmerciful cavalry have been sweeping across the plains of Calradia in an unprecedented conquest of blood and fire! Every city he has come across has fallen under his mighty fist. There is still much to do, as currently his faction, the Khergit Khanate, is at war with the Kingdom of Swadia and the Kingdom of Vaegirs. However, we have completely eradicated the Sarranid Sultanate and the Kingdom of Rhodoks. The only downside I can see about this game is that the battles get repetitive after awhile. But seriously though, buy this game, and lose yourself in an era of history, geography, and politics as expansive and as interesting as the real-world.
