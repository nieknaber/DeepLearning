Fun game, side scrolling beat-em up with some role playing elements like leveling up and stats. Feels a lot like Battletoads with some levels being the same way. Multiplayer is a bonus. Combat can get monotonous. With online multiplayer, there is there is more lag than there should be and it can be hard to find players at times.
