The average download estimated by Steam is about 8 hours on 1 gig<br /><br />This game is fun! I can't believe my PC can handle a game like this with so much particles in the graphics. I like the new ranking system, it makes the gaming experience worth while.  I was able to purchase my weapon of choice and add my favorite perks in no time. It's good to have an advanced weapon at low ranks.
