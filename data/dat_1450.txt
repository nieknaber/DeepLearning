All in all, it's an okay game. Not necessarily a simulator, but a nice try. The game itself is a great concept, but unfortunately once you've played the game for 45 minutes the game starts losing appeal because you're doing the exact same procedure over and over again. There's not a lot of variety in the game and once you've figured it out it becomes tiresome and boring.<br /><br />Pros are that it's actually not the most unrealistic game I've ever played. It's a good concept that's allowed to be fairly detailed. You can drive the cars, which is a plus, and they drive fairly normally.<br /><br />Cons are that it's a pretty blatant knockoff of Gearhead Garage and the game is played the same way, but with a higher level of detail. In Car Mech you can drive the cars in a test environ. In Gearhead you couldn't. In Gearhead you could buy cars and fix them up. In Car Mech, you can't. If you think this game will teach you how to work on cars, you're 100% wrong. It's a game to be played and beaten, and it has almost no educational factors beyond generalities. If you didn't like Gearhead Garage, you won't like Car Mechanic Simulator.<br /><br />It's a good revision of an older game, and it's done nicely with the addition of test driving and chip tuning. At the end of the day it's a game that, once learned, loses a lot of the attraction power. You end up doing the same thing to every car, doing the same mundane tasks job after job.<br /><br />As a simulation of what it's like to be a mechanic, that's actually accurate, but it's that very mundane redundancy that makes it less than thrilling to do it for real. This is that mundane redundancy minus the greasy hands and burnt transmission fluid smell.
