I purchased this download because this is probably one of two computer games I was ever truly addicted to when I was a teenager. I hadn't played it in years, but since it was so cheap it seemed like an obvious purchase and I wasn't disappointed! Still fun, easy to play, and similar enough to the original to pick it back up.<br /><br />If you haven't played tropico before, it is like sim city, except you are an island dictator that needs to not only build up the city, but also work to keep your people happy so you can stay in power. Very addictive (in a good way!).
