I do not like the cuts of the puzzle pieces. The classic cut is not what I consider classic cuts. The number of puzzle pieces per picture has too great of a choice...either small number of pieces or jumps to too many pieces and colors could be better. Wouldn't recommend buying the puzzles. Wished you had a way to move pieces instead of selecting to arrange all. Tried using the index to see if it was explained better. It had nothing there other than to say I have to buy the puzzle!! I had purchased the puzzle.
