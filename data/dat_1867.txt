It was good for the price for a few days of entertainment but I wouldn't pay more than a few bucks for it. It's kind of fun; it can be complicated at first figuring things out and it gets frustrating; as soon as you defeat it, though, there is little challenge left. Not something I would play over and over again but it was amusing while it lasted.
