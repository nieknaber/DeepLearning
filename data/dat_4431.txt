I've been playing this game for years but all of a sudden it quit working cause Yahoo (where I bought it) discontinued it. I bought it again here and while it's the same game, now the Dictionary no longer works. Clicking on a word takes me to an IE GameHouse page that says something like Sorry page no longer found. It used to take me to a Dictionary page showing the definition of whatever word I had clicked. That's a pretty large function that is no longer working. Even though I have loved the game for years, I'm now just giving it just one star because of lacking the Dictionary.
