Purchased this one (4 Star) and the other one (3 Star) for my Son, he likes them both and that alone is worth 10 bucks each for me, I played through this one which was more a FPS feel and being in the movie feel more than the other one. I was playing them for my son and I did enjoy it while the second one I got pulled away from and haven't made it back yet. My son has though. This one felt a little more FPS like. Neither are bad game overall but I'd not expect to be blown away either. These are Dated, Ghostbusters itself seems geared towards kids more and even the movies though excellent classics were silly to some degree as well. If you love the Ghostbusters it is likely a must have, if you have kids that love the Ghostbusters it is likely a must have, if you just wanting something different it not a bad buy really if you want the latest and greatest then you should probably move on.. It could be an addition to a goto list/library as well depending on the person..
