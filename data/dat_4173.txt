I've been playing this game for a while now after deciding to go for it and purchase it.<br />The game play is amazing. It feels like a combination of Mirror's Edge, and Skyrim, only with zombies. Zombies don't die on the first hit, or even the second...or third....or fourth...unless you get a critical hit. Weapons degrade after use and must be repaired. Weapons only have a few times it can be repaired, after that it's useless.<br /><br />PROS:<br />-Gameplay<br />-Graphics<br />-Skill system<br />-Night time hunting<br /><br />CONS:<br />-Lacking in story<br />-Mediocre voice acting<br />-Not enough multiplayer game types<br /><br />Overall though I would definitely recommend this game if you are in for a fresh zombie killing game. The co-op is super fun with others and can be enjoyed many hours with it doing the side quests.
