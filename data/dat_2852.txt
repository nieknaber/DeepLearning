Good:<br /><br />The level designs are pretty great, and I really love the target and auto-kill skill. Once you have points to use it, all you have to is it mark up to 4 enemies, and let Sam do all the killing within 2-3 seconds.<br /><br />I like the earning points for doing stuff, so that you can upgrade your guns -  feature.<br /><br />The storyline is a lot better, even though it is still ridiculous and not believable.<br /><br />I also like the new way that mission objectives are displayed.<br /><br />Bad:<br /><br />DRM: DO NOT BUY the the Mac or PC version regardless of any news of Ubisoft toning the DRM down a notch; it's not true. I got this game on Steam, but it uses Ubisoft's flavor of DRM which is what you'll get if you buy it from Amazon. Whenever I couldn't connect to Ubisoft's server for whatever reason, it would just stop my single player game until it was able to hit Ubisoft's server again. Think about this. If you have a spotty internet connection this will be horrible, or better yet what will happen when Ubisoft shuts down their servers on a weekend or for good? This happened multiple times in the early levels and it is really annoying when you knew that you paid to just experience this horrible security feature that does nothing to stop the pirates. I'm pretty sure you can find a pirate version easily. All this garbage inconveniences Ubisoft's paying customers forever, making them more inclined to pirate. NEVER BUY ANYTHING FROM UBISOFT. If you really have to have it, but it on a console instead. They will work fine without the always on internet DRM.<br /><br />Lion compatibility: I got it working in Lion, but it wasn't easy and I think a lot of it was luck.<br /><br />I could not find anyone online for multiplayer games, especially for the co-op portion of the game.<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />This is the best Splinter Cell in my book... ruined by Ubisoft DRM. I could be wrong but I don't think 360 or PS3 owners are affected by this, so if you have to get it just buy it on a console instead.
