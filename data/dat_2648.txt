I bought the PS3 Digital Code and I can say it works with no problems.<br />Expect to wait a while for it to download, however (it IS 17GB of over-the-internet-content), as it can take up to 3 hours to complete (that's with a fairly high internet speed).<br />Either way, it's a much faster alternative to waiting for the game to arrive from delivery, and also avoids anything that could harm the disk during travel.<br />Oh, and did I mention that it's considerably cheaper than the 360 version? That is definitely a bonus for me~
