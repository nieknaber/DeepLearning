This bundle is one of many that Amazon offers for a cheap price during their various sales, a nice way to grab two good games for a discount. However, when sales aren't going on, the price of the bundles goes back up to retail. I don't know why Amazon doesn't just make them unavailable until the next sale, but that still doesn't warrant the one-star reviews.<br /><br />Lego Lord of the Rings is great, as a fan of both the Traveler's Tales Lego games and Lord of the Rings. It sadly doesn't have online co-op, only split screen, but apparently none of the Lego games have online play on PC. A good one to play with kids, a significant other, or by yourself, you nerd.<br /><br />Scribblenauts Unlimited might be the best entry in the Scribblenauts series. It's never looked cleaner, had more depth or objects to create, and it's just a fun little game. Just like Lego LOTR, this a great one for kids or adults, something that can be hard to find.<br /><br />Both games activate through Steam, simple and effective for my needs.
