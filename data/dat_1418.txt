I never had a reason to invest in PSN + until I got my PS4, now I don't know how I went without it. The library of games for my PS4, PS3 and Vita make it a great deal even at full price of $49.99, but getting it for $29.99 today was even better. That's just $2.50 a month to play an entire library of titles for the 3 systems. Amazon makes digital transactions so easy too. This was one of the only things that I thought might get me out of the house on Black Friday and it turned out I could buy it on line. Thanks Amazon.
