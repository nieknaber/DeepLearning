Have been reading the Horus Heresy series from The Black Library, and was stoked to be able to buy these skins, as well as the Traitor Legions pack. Has 2 unique skins that you can use. Bonus for me that my favorite Loyalist Legion, the Space Wolves, is one of them. Full price, only if you REALLY need to have it RIGHT NOW; otherwise, these DLC go on sale often, definitely pick them up on sale if you own WH40k:SM game.
