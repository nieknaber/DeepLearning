Price 1/1<br /><br />It's free. Need I say more?<br /><br />Functionality 2/2<br /><br />This game is like Bejeweled, which is a game format that I really enjoy, so I was excited to find this free download. It's a great time-killer, and I can play for hours if I'm really into it. I downloaded this back in 09/2011, and I haven't played much since the initial few weeks. Nonetheless, if I ever need to kill some time, this is a good option. I'm not a huge fan of the built-in screensaver as I like the Windows screensaver that tells me the time.<br /><br />Endurance 1/1<br /><br />I haven't experienced any glitches or errors while playing, installing, or running the game. The game takes about 13.7 MB of space on my laptop, which is fair.<br /><br />Other 0.5/1<br /><br />As I mentioned previously, I haven't played this game much recently. This is not because the game is too boring or too easy/challenging but because there are better alternatives for me to spend time on. If I do not have an internet connection though, this will be high on my list of things to do on my computer. If puzzle games are not your cup of tea, then do not buy this game.<br /><br />OVERALL SCORE 4.5 / 5
