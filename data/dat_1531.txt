when I read that update 10.1 patch allows you to play offline, they (EA/Origin) forget to tell you that this game does not work well with Windows 8.1.  I tried to change the compatablitity to widows 7 and that still does not work.  I was able to get logged onto the online server once, but does do the update.  Most of the time it keeps trying to log onto the update server but gives the error SMCY25.  When you try the update it only sends you to a bunch of articles written by the company.  Little biased, and really nothing worth reading on how to fix it other then two options make sure you have a strong internet connection with mine is 50+ MPS download, and 12 Upload ... the other option is contact the help live.  It was a 55minute or longer wait to be connected to live help.  This is why they need to learn quit making online only games when the majority want to play offfline.  Neither EA or Origin have a way to download the 10.1 patch from their site ... and of course the servers are still pitiful.  The one time I was able to get connected to a server, it did not give me the ability to switch to single player which is the offline mode.  Then it dawned on me, to play offline you have to log online probably to play offline.<br />UPDATE:  It stated to be able to play off line, you need to log on via \\"Origin\\" and have \\"Offline\\" marked in \\"Origin\\" when you do this it says \\"Origin offline unable to play\\".  So still offline is not true.  I think I was able to update it said all updates are done ... but not able to play off line.
