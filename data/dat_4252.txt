I downloaded this on Ubuntu 10.04 with Wine-1.2.2.  It works flawlessly but I did have to configure it a little.  In order to download it, you need the Amazon installer which also runs only on Windows.  This is annoying but it worked fine with Wine too.  Once downloaded, I started the game, but it defaults to full screen and it's resolution was out of range of my monitor and I had to reboot.  I configured Wine with a virtual desktop of 1024x768 and it worked perfectly.  I also like the classic mode better, as the enhanced mode has a shadow which looks like screen ghosting and is annoying.
