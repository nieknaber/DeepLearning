DRMBM is actually a puzzle game rather than your average platformer. It's actually based off of the Adventures of Sonic the Hedgehog show and it is probably the only game to be.<br /><br />The main game is connecting 3 of the same color. It's Puyo Puyo but with an American Sonic theme. There's a VS mode, a Training mode (Which is like playing solo in Tetris), and a Story mode that pits you against Dr. Robotnik's half-baked robots.<br /><br />The Game Over screen is pretty funny. During the countdown time for you to continue, Dr. Robotnik dances and taunts during the whole countdown. At the near end of it, he laughs evilly.<br /><br />The puzzling gameplay is pretty addicting, and it is still a fun game to this day.
