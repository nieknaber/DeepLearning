\\"The 7th Guest\\" was always one of my old favorite computer games in the early 90's.  For the longest time I wished I could play it again, but alas, due to computer operating updates it was no longer possible -- until now!  I'm running a Windows 7 - 64 bit system and the download worked like a charm!  While \\"The 7th Guest\\" was a computer game marvel upon its initial release with its graphics, game length, etc.  Younger game enthusiasts may be somewhat disappointed with the \\"action\\" by comparison of today's computer graphic abilities.  The game, however, still gives that overall \\"creepy\\" feeling while playing, and many of the puzzles will keep a gamer busy trying to solve them for quite a long time. If anyone is unsure whether or not this game might be for them, I would suggest that they view a sample of the game on \\"YouTube\\" that folks have uploaded (but don't continue watching any puzzles actually being solved -- unless necessary). If you enjoy puzzles and a little creepy mystery then this game may be for you!
