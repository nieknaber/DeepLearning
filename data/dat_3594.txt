while the ram II did receive a weight nerf of around 600 extra lbs, it still is a fast firing, and maneuverable tier 5 tank, getting a 100% crew and extra gold and a garage slot is 1300 gold in free stuff for the tank that if you bought through the ingame store would not be offered with it.  The extra gold is good for all kinds of things, but I used it to buy some camo on the tank and convert free XP from the tank to help the grind.  well worth the money.
