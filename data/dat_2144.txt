I can't give a full review of this game, really. Because i have not finished it, and do not plan on finishing. The story seems like it COULD become interesting at some point. The open-world environment seems like it COULD be fun to play around in... but i can't get around the wonky controls. Literally can't get around them, as in i can't customize them into being worthwhile.
