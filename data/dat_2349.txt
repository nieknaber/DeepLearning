I saw that Amazon.com had Cryostasi available as a downloadable game for a great price.  I'd heard good things about this game and the demo was available, so I thought I'd give it a try.  What a dog it turned out to be.<br /><br />Firstly I cranked all the graphics setting to their highest in the options menu.  I have a nice gaming system that gives me great frame rates with most of the newest games(LFD2, Bioshock 2 etc...)maxed out graphics wise.  I usually start there and adjust down if needed.  I normally don't need to.  After I had done this with Cryostasis and started the game, first thing that happened was my system froze...  Or so I thought.  A couple of seconds later, it went to another frame, seconds later another, etc...  I knew right away this was going to be a dog.  I turned the graphics down quite a bit and still had a choppy frame rate.<br /><br />Combat was chunky.  Graphics looked awful.  I tried playing for a few minutes and decided it wasn't worth suffering through to see if there was anything interesting about this game.  I'm so glad I tried the demo first.  Even at the low Amazon price of about $6.50 for the full game, I would have felt like I flushed that money down the toilet.<br /><br />I went back to read the reviews of the full game and found out a lot of people were complaining about the same things I was with this demo.  So I'm pretty certain the full game would be just like the demo.  Glad I saved my money.
