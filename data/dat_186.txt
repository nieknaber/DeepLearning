Mortal kombat Komplete Edition is a good continuation of the franchise.<br />Although there is a Story Mode added to the game, it doesn't add a great deal of value compared to the original format.<br />Sometimes this Story Mode serves up a few challenges you don't really want away from just doing basic fighting.<br />Thankfully, it isn't required to complete it to compete in regular arcade fighting.
