Fans of Emily of \\"Delicious\\" fame and her delightful exploits in time management are in for a new treat.  Her new customers, as well as, some old favorites, are a humorous treat depicting our various shapes and sizes.  This is jam-packed with new food items to create and greatly varying restaurant locations.  Although a game of skill, the story line and characters, especially Emily, leave the player with a \\"feel-good\\" mood whether you won or not.  For a good time and some challenges this game is up there with the best of \\"Delicious.\\"  A great game to get you in the Christmas spirit is \\"Delicious - Emily's Holiday Season.\\"  This \\"True Love\\" premium edition has the usual quirky added activities and a bonus 10 days if you watch the credits.  If you get addicted to this charming game, \\"Delicious - Emily's Tea Garden\\" is the most challenging in the last restaurant, of course, the Tea Garden.  If you like time management games that don't make you want to pull your hair out...this is ideal.  I have also had good results in downloading from Amazon which is not always been the case with other web-sites.  A new feature - the customers lined up at the cash register actually change lines in this adorable new game.  Hope you have as much fun with this as I have!!!  Can't wait for the next one!!!!!
