The quality of the games in this pack is without question if you were a fan of Sega back in the day, if lacking Sonic games, which Sega is obviously holding out on. However, the crashes are problematic. In about one hour of gameplay, across a couple of sessions, I have experienced crashes:<br /><br />1. When going from fullscreen to windowed mode<br />2. When performing a quicksave<br />3. When exiting the program<br /><br />Once the game crashes, you will need to go into the program manager to close it out. The experience has been very frustrating.
