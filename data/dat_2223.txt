My 5 year old son is beginning to read and I wanted a game that would encourage that.  This game obviously doesn't appear from the outside to enhance reading skills but in fact it does have some reading required within.  Once you complete some of the little jewel quest type match games you have to do undersea hunts in which he has to be able to read the words of the objects he is looking for and then find the item.  THis game has really good graphics and my son now has an aquarium filled with over 1500 fish and every item imaginable.  He plays it twice a week and it is now one of his favorite games.  I highly recommend this to anyone looking for a game for their 5-7 year olds.
