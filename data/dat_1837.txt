It's an incredibly bare bones PC port. There's no online multiplayer to speak of, it requires tinkering with game files just to change the resolution, and if you don't have a controller to use for your PC then don't even bother playing it. Not to mention there are only 8 levels and you'll have played through them all in about 2 hours. It's a pretty meh PC port and it's clear that the developers didn't really care about porting it over which means you shouldn't care about playing it.
