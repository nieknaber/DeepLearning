I am a long time LOTRO player.  Turbine did a good story line here.  I found this more interesting the some of the previous story lines.  I don't run epic battle much, but it is an interesting concept. Mounted combat is interesting.  Might not be the best out there, but fairly easy to learn and enjoyable.  Cosmetics are great!  One area Turbine often is the leader in.  If you like cool looking armor and weapons that are realistic this is the game for you.
