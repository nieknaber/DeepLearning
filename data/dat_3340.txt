Worked through this program uneventfully until near the end when the program kept shutting down. Despite numerous reboots, uninstalls and reinstalls, the game continues to shut down at the same point. I contacted Alawar but no help there. I know this is a common problem because when I did a search on the internet, I found numerous instances of people who had the same issue. No one could come up with a solution. Some said their vendor gave them a refund for the game. I would have liked to finish the program after spending several hours trying to get to the end of the game.
