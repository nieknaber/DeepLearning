I've had fun playing this with my friend's teenage kids, and it's a bit of nostalgia for me.  Although I don't like scary shooter-type games, this one doesn't scare me as much and is more fun.  I think it's because everything is in full view on your screen, nothing attacks you from outside your view.  I would have given it 5 stars if there was more information about the characters within the game and some hints about what their special powers were.
