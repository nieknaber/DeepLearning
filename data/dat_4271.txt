This was a good Super Granny game but not the best. The difficulty of play was too uneven. There were levels that were nearly impossible to beat--one was among the first levels played and there were levels that were so easy they were laughable. On the hard levels, it was a good thing you started off with 8 or 9 lives because you needed all of them to beat that level. There were some good levels where you had to think to figure out what to do, but the unevenness of play hurt the overall quality of the game. Granny in Paradise is still my favorite version of this game.
