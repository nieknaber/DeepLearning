So this game is region locked to only those in the US. I bought it anyway with an address that I made through 'Borderlinx' I tried activating the game from Europe (Where I live) on Steam. They told me it was not available for purchase in my country. Which I kind of suspected would happen.<br /><br />So I googled \\"US VPN Steam\\" got one working in about 5 minutes. (FlyVPN with the trial account on their page)<br />Then I logged in, swapped my location to the US through the VPN and activated this game.<br /><br />I spit in the face of companies and organisations who region lock and DRM games. I paid the money for this, fair and square I own it and I don't care where I live. I should have the right to play it.<br /><br />The game unlocked as 'Dead Island Goty NA'<br />I logged out. Exited Steam. Turned off the VPN.<br />Logged back into Steam and downloaded the game.<br /><br />Hopefully they won't ban me.. ( I DID pay for the game.. ) would they rather me pirate it?<br />This is the only game I have bought from Steam. I also have Metro 2033 which was a free giveaway through Facebook. Plus a mate Gifted me Torchlight 2 which I haven't touched.<br /><br />Regardless I don't wish to be banned but I will take the chance.<br /><br />Good luck and please reply if it worked for you.<br /><br />P.S. Buying this grants you a 5 discount towards Dead Island 'Riptide' from Amazon which isn't out yet.
