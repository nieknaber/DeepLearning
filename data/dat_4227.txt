UPDATE: I really like this game and I'm at LVL 35. But there never seems to be many online games to play. Like 1-5 online games to play. Tried Googling for an answer with no luck. Can anyone help out?<br /><br />First of all I rate this game a 4.5!<br /><br />I am a PC co-op gamer. I don't play a lot of PC games, but when I do I play, I prefer co-op. The best co-op that I have ever played was City of Heroes. The game allowed for 8 players to team-up and do various missions together. A lot of chatting before the missions which I enjoyed. I was able to team-up with regular players on a consistent basis which made playing COH a whole lot of fun.<br /><br />Borderlands 2 is an excellent co-op PC game. Though not as personal as COH was. And I really miss that personal touch that COH had. But nonetheless, this is a very entertaining and fast action game to play. I am at level 22 right now and having a blast! The game seems to get better and better as I progress through it.<br /><br />I was kind of leary about the graphics before my purchase, being cartoonish and all. Especially after playing BF3 and Black OPS 2. But once you start playing BL2, it doesn't really matter at all. In fact, I find the graphics pretty cool.<br /><br />I've gotten really burned out on the typical FPSers like Battlefield and COD. From what I've experienced from them, it's nothing more than the boring K/D ratio. (Kills vs. Death ratio.) Boringgggg.<br /><br />Borderlands 2 combines the best of both worlds. FPS and RPG. And a very good co-op. Like I said before, I'm having a blast!<br /><br />Note: For those wondering how well they can play BL2 on their computers... here is my rig that I play on... that works very well with no hiccups...<br /><br />Lenovo G770 Laptop<br />i5 Sandy Bridge 2.3 processor<br />6 GB Ram<br />AMD Radeon HD 6650M<br /><br />And most importantly, which makes a big difference in playability... The free downloadable \\"Game Booster 3\\" app!
