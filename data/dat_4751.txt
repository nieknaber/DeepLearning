Since I do not like to use my credit/debit cards online and Turbine has stopped marketing purchasable &#34;DDO Points&#34; cards (at least in my area), Amazon's carrying this product, along with a savvy gift card from a well intended relative, made this lovely little expansion possible.  DDO is a fine MMORPG and I recommend it highly, whether you are a free to play, or subscription, player.
