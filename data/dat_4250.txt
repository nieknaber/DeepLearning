As an older woman who loves PC games, I just love this collection of Dream Day Wedding games. I'm sure the younger generation would like them too as you get to dress the bride, make the cake, set the wedding scenery, etc.  I like them because I can mindlessly, without stress play these games. Because I've played each one numerous times (I hate to admit) it's still a fun, easy way to relieve stress.
