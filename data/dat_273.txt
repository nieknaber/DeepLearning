Don't waste your money!!!!  I had the actual game at one time so I know my computer is compatible. I thought I'd download the game instead of spend a bunch of money buying another game cd......well,it was the wrong choice.  Once I paid for the download--to which there is NO refund,an error message came up saying it was incompatible with my computer!  Bull.
