Seek & Find to the max, with more and more search scenes to complete with each level (but the searches are easy, so they don't take forever). As a plus, there are discs scattered around each search area and, for each 5 of these you find, you get an extra hint (or an item revealed immediately, if your hints are full).<br /><br />At the end of a level you face an interesting puzzle challenge or mini-game from one of the Aztec gods, who then gives you something, usually something to wear... for some reason... to help in some way, I suppose... but I dunno what way they help, since they don't help you search better or faster. Well, except for the extra hint hearts, I guess they could help if the searches were at all hard, but they're not, so you don't really *need* them... the extra hint hearts, I mean... now I'm confused... anyway, they're fun to find. The stuff the gods give you just seems to have the effect of making you look more Aztechy(ish?) as you progress through the levels of the game. Or, rather, it would, if your character wasn't wearing casual slacks and a tee, which definitely don't mix with ancient Aztec regalia very well.
