Wow, I'm surprised at how little 5-star review this game has gotten! While I might not have the experience of others when it comes to the Sims, I have had enough to say that I found this to be a welcome addition to an already-amazing game. In truth, I mostly use the new hairstyles. The vacation feature is nice, but expensive. My legacy challenge is just starting out, and can't afford it yet. :P I've played on another save and (using cheats) got enough money to rent out the best cabin. I've had a lot of fun playing on that save! I love how you can interact with the guy hidden in the woods. He's cool!!
