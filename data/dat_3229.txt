This is not a download of the actual software, it's a key so you can download Steam to your computer and play the game though Steam. If I realized this I never would have purchased it, I would have patiently waited for the hard copy in the mail.<br /><br />Steam frequently takes many minutes to update and load every time I start the computer...very frustrating. Now I can't play the game at all and the Steam web site suggests it might be because I am using one of 50 to 75 programs they have compatibility issues with, including most anti-virus and firewall programs.<br /><br />The game itself is great when it works! Buy the boxed version!
