I found the artistic style of the game to be the best part it: changing colour palettes for surroundings as the mood of the game evolves, not over-the-top steam-punk technology, posters, short films and dialogues between random characters reflecting the blend of religious, ethnic and patriotic fervour of the fictional u(dys)topia.<br /><br />The combat mechanics are simple, but you probably won't get bored because the game isn't drawn out. Also it doesn't feel like you're watching a movie with mini-games shoehorned in between scenes which is great.<br /><br />The story and the universe are well-crafted, the sci-fi elements are explained to a decent level and don't require painful suspension of disbelief.<br /><br />I will go as far as to say that the soundtrack was better than any game I have ever played before. Most songs are symbolically interwoven with the story, some are used to playfully enrich the environment and the combat music isn't annoying.<br /><br />Overall, Bioshock Infinite is great for people seeking an amazing and unpredictable story, a feeling of escape into another world or for those who enjoy plain and simple FPS games.<br /><br />*You don't have to have had played Bioshock 1 and 2 to immerse yourself in this games' universe.*
