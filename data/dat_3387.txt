Just to add to the already positive reviews about Bioshock Infinite, I found the game to be a great game to mark the end of a generation on. Like the original Bioshock before it, Infinite showcases setting and place in a visual world for you to enjoy. Infinite showcases on the PC what \\"next-gen\\" will be like. Colombia in many ways is like Rapture and improves upon the scale that they both try to convey in their worlds. The big winner in the game is the story and the making of turn of the century Americana exemplified come alive. It may not be for everyone who loves non-stop action and multiplayer, but people who enjoy a 15 hr journey into a different world will find it enjoyable.
