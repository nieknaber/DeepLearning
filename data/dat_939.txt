I'll tell you up front, if you're more interested in graphics than game-play, you're probably not going to like this.  I actually almost stopped playing this as soon as I started, but I decided to give it a chance; I'm glad I did, as I was pleasantly surprised/entertained.  I guess it's true when they say not to judge a book by it's cover (or a game by it's graphics in this case).
