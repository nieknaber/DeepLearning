The game play for Inquisition drags on and on and on.  Combat is restricted to short range engagements of only a few enemies at a time and the amount of skills and abilities that the characters have is greatly reduced from previous dragon age games.  One of the big selling points of the game is the quality of the graphics engine and the new visuals.  But the visuals aren't advanced much over the previous Dragon Age game.  When you consider the fact that there is no official mod support for this game and no planned mod support for the future, I don't think the mild improvement in visual quality justifies the switch to another engine.  Add to that the fact that the control scheme was clearly designed for consoles only, and there's very little reason to buy Inquisition if you are a PC gamer.<br /><br />I would personally recommend that PC gamers steer clear of games developed on the Frostbite Engine until the designers have updated it for use with the PC instead of the console.
