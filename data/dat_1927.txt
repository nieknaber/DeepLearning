If you Played rollercoaster Tycoon 2, then you will love this game. With the introduction of a day/night setup, as well as firework shows, better graphics (other than the Guests, now called Peeps), new rollercoasters, the ability to import coaster from past games, and even a revised guest system (they are now groups, like families) you will be very busy. also comes with the two expansion packs, which allow you to build pools/animal enclosures/Lion(or dolphin/whale) shows, and much more. My only qualm is with parts of the rollercoaster designer, which while bringing new, interesting coasters to the game, also doesn't work as well as Rollercoaster Tycoon 2's designer (Which you can import from anyways).
