Amazon, and the Game Code worked flawlessly.  Im giving a 3/5 stars for the game.  I personally don't really enjoy it even though it was highly acclaimed and recommended by many many many reviews.  The fact that just adventuring can skip ahead in the main quest story accidentally is just...well...  Anyways, as always Amazon delivered perfectly.
