Lots of action packed into a well-priced video game. Especially enjoy playing online. In fact, the only things I don't like are the kinda depressing graphics in some game locales and that I can only choose some form of gun as my weapon - though each gun's stats are pretty fun, especially in higher levels. Otherwise, this is a great game.
