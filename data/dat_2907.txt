I bought this on sale, I'd rather not have bought it at all. This story should have been fleshed out, and the game should have been made for a PC and Console and ported/dumbed down for the phone. It was done the other way though and it is apparent. It feels like a clumsy and lobotomized version of Human Revolution.
