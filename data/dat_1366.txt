I purchased these cartel coin packs. And I can say it was a very good investment! Not only do you get a bonus in-game mini pet but the market place changes so much adding great things to purchase as well as discounted items.<br /><br />My advice is buy multiple cards and always keep a stock pile of coins just in case that certain item you want goes on sale!  Also with the instant delivery from amazon you'll have your cartel coins in no time!<br /><br />It's a win win for all!
