The games work great and they are all included -- once you figure out that they've automatically downloaded to different directories. \\"Colonists\\" downloads to Programs folder, while the rest of the Civ games download to the Programs x86 folder. Amazon won't tell you that (they just sell it, they don't provide installation info) so you'll think you only got \\"Colonists\\" at first. Even if you start by directing the download to your \\"Games\\" (for example) folder, the rest of it goes to the Programs x86 folder. But yep, once you figure that out, everything is hunky dory and the games play just great! BTW, if you've previously played Civ IV on disk, all the included downloaded expansion packs play as separate games in themselves not simply as upgrades to the main game. Loves me some Civ IV!
