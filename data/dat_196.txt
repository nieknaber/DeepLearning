Seems like a DOS port of an old game. I wanted a cheap chess game that could be played by two human players or against the machine...and which wasn't a 2 gig download. It does work, but just barely. There was another chess game for the same price with good reviews, but as far as I can tell, you can only play against the computer on it. And the other downloadable chess game was two player, but also 2 gig.    Looking around the web, the screen shot of the game shows a 3D board, but that is a screen shot when starting up. The actual board you play on is 2d only. That's not a huge issue, but it is a little deceptive. The huge deal is that when you get to the end of a game, it just freezes up and you have to control-alt-delete to get out of the game. If you run in windows mode, you can just exit out of the game, but the game wants to jump to full screen by default.     The options are almost non-existent. Help, too. You only get one choice of chess pieces and the king and queen look so much alike that you almost have to click on them to see how many squares they can move to in order to tell them apart. The rest of the options are, easy, medium, and hard modes, and human vs. human or human vs machine. That's it. That's all your options.    With all that said, I played chess with my son and he liked it. If given the choice again, I should have downloaded the 2-gig game over night...or ordered something on DVD. :(
