I purchased the game, I went to En Masse site and registered the game. Downloaded the installer and my account was only given 1 day play time instead of the 30 days advertised. When I contacted their customer service they said they are aware and there is no fix. They said to just set a subscription to continue playing. Not a very good answer for someone who just plopped down $60 and you tell them you need another $15 to play the game for the 30 days that are included? Very very disappointed in their service. I won't be playing this after all.<br /><br />It really is a shame since the game itself looks amazing and the combat is fun. You can play with keyboard and mouse or a gamepad! You are not sitting there looking at cool down bars, you can watch the monster for tells and react. It was a blast for the one day I was able to play it. Oh well... Good thing Diablo 3 shipped.
