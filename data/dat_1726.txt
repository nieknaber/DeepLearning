I dont know, I honestly dont know how much more of this I can take. This past year has crushed me too many times with titles I held dear to my heart.<br /><br />  Mass Effect 3, such an awesome, brilliant and stunning game to end the franchise with......up until the final 20 minutes of the game. Its like Michelangelo completing 95% of a masterpiece only to hand the brush off to a child to finish the last 5%.<br /><br />  Diablo 3, what a letdown that was. Coming from years of playing the amazing Diablo 2, so excited for Diablo 3 to release and then realize you have been handed a real money auction house simulator.......<br /><br />  And now Sim City, with all the server problems, crashes and rollbacks. I have been able to play a few hours over the last few days. I did pay for this game mind you.... but, sadly that is not what is killing this game for me. What is killing this game is the city size, or lack there of. Compared to past Sim City games the plot sizes are insanely small. The game play, when you can play, is so much fun, but when you have such a small plot to work with it just takes all the creativity out of it. I compare it to being giving the keys to a (insert dream sports car here) and then finding out you can only drive it to the end of the driveway and back.<br /><br />  The disappointment with franchises I hold dear to me has left me a very jaded video game nerd.
