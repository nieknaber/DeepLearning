This game is fantastic. The atmosphere and mood of this game are great. I played it in the dark with the volume up high, it really added to the creepy factor. All around this is an enjoyable game, as long as you aren't one of those people who have to have perfect graphics and voice acting. If I had to compare it to other horror classics like Resident Evil or Silent Hill, I would say this is better. Don't get me wrong, those games are still amazing, but this game genuinely made me feel scared. The controls aren't the world's best, but they get the job done. I highly recommend this game!
