This is definitely a niche game designed for a certain type of person.  I am that type of person.  I downloaded the demo and played for about three hours before deciding to go ahead and buy it.  My initial hesitation was that at first it can be a little boring just taking jobs for other people.  I didn't bother to buy my own truck while playing the demo so I didn't do the free drive feature or modify and paint any trucks.  All of these features and running your own trucking company really help open up gameplay.  Driving the highways, just like real life, can be long and boring; driving around cities and not taking damage or getting a ticket can be a challenge.  I haven't really started exploring on my own or managing other drivers but I'm looking forward to that.<br /><br />The graphics are decent, nice textures, colors and detail.  I love driving the England country side in the rain just before dawn.  I have a [[ASIN:B00I668566 Sapphire Radeon HD 7770 1GB DDR5 HDMI/DVI-I/DP PCI-Express Graphics Card 11201-25-20G]]and have all the graphics on the highest setting and it runs with no problem.  I have noticed that if I use the mouse to \\"turn my head\\" inside the cab there is a brief stutter sometimes.<br /><br />The physics feel pretty real to me.  The truck is much faster to accelerate and stop with no load.  I have almost tipped when going down an off ramp too fast.<br /><br />A minor annoyance is that I'll turn on the lights, drive for awhile and a fine for driving light offense will pop up.  I'll look down and the lights are off and I have no idea why.  I also recommend a console controller or wheel set up.  Driving by keyboard can be problematic.  There is a good deal of repetiton and it's not as open world as I would like.  Each city is pretty much the same, just a small four or five block area with hotels, workshops, and depots to perform various tasks.  Don't expect to drive a big rig under the Arc De Triomphe in Grand Theft Auto style.<br /><br />I don't know what it is about this game but friends I've discussed it with tease me and sometimes I play it up because on the surface it sounds like a boring concept.  The thing is if you have to have it explained you probably still wouldn't get it.  It's relaxing in a way my favorite games like XCOM are not.  If you are considering buying this game I suggest reading both the negative and positive reviews and base your decision on gameplay because all of the mechanics are well designed and thought out.  If driving around Europe (sometimes rather slowly) sounds like something you would enjoy this is your game.iends I've discussed it with tease me and sometimes I play it up because on the surface it sounds like a boring concept.
