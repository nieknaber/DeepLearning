I was too quick to buy the Sims 3, for my macbook pro, when I didn't think how slow and useless it would really be. I can't get past 10 seconds of the game without it crashing on me. A waste of 26 dollars. I remember having similar problems with The Sims 2, but on a whole different computer. Really, upset. :(
