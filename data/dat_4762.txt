I think that ARMA2 is unique in the field of shooters in that I know of no other game that provides the same level of detail and realism.  I generally get bored with FPS games but the level of depth in ARMA2 managed to draw me in and really occupy me.<br /><br />Despite the fun the game provides, the game is very buggy and has some performance issues.  If you play ARM2 in the campaign make sure you save often.  The most painful problem is the scripting bugs within in the game that prevent objectives from being reached.<br /><br />Graphics are aged but still respectable.  There is a healthy modding community (Day Z for example) and it is only getting bigger.<br /><br />I bought the combined arms pack for $30 and I feel that this is a fair price that I wold recommend to any person looking for a great in depth shooter who also has a little patience.
