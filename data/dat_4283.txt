How could they release this game? It's a complete failure. It doesn't work properly and uses too much system resources. The game requires too much micro management. I have a core i5 and 16 GB memory. After I increased the graphics quality my computer died. This game functions like a virus. It breaks your system. They should send their developers back to school.
