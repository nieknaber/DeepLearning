So far I'm loving this game! I've been into them all since GTA3. This will keep me busy until 5 comes out. I had a crash on my first launch of the game, but none after that. I was shortly after I updated graphic settings to 100% for everything. After the crash, I was notified of an update available and I installed it. I also took the visible distance settings to a little lower. Game has run flawless after that. Not sure if it was slightly decreasing my graphic settings, or the update. Maybe both. Either way, works great on my Win 7 x64 machine!
