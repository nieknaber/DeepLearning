This is a great expansion for the Sims.  It allows the sims to have more flexibility with their career choices.  A couple of the options include fashion stylist, fire fighter, and investigator.  These careers are better than most of the Sims careers because you get to control your sim while they are working.  For instance, the sylist sim allows you to actively select what the makeover will be.  The firefighter Sim has you control his response time to fires and him actually putting out fires.<br /><br />This expansion works well with pets because although your job may run from 9AM-5PM, you only have to be onsite if there is a task for you.  If there isn't a task, you can stay at home with your pet developing needed skills for your career.<br /><br />The instant access feature is a quick and easy way to get the game set up on your system for those that already have an Origin account.
