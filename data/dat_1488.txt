The game is cute and requires some thought.  It is not trivial.<br /><br />There are no options and it is simply windowed.  There is no \\"full screen\\" option.  Fortunately, with a game with no options, there is no music!  No sound effects either.<br /><br />It is a tangram puzzle in that you place the pieces into the form of a 4 X 4 block (at least for the beginner puzzles -- all I've played so far).  You cannot rotate the pieces so you have to work with what you have.<br /><br />The misleading part is that you MUST have internet access while playing the game.  That is not in the game description and it should be.  It appears that you only need the access to get the levels which makes no sense.  They should be there somewhere!<br /><br />I thank the previous reviewer for pointing this out and I have tested it.  I put my internet on \\"standby\\" and I cannot get to the puzzles.<br /><br />For a 30+ MB download ending with a 54 MB game (small by today's standards), it should have the data for all the levels there -- or have an option to download them to prevent having to use the internet.  What happens if you're playing and the internet crashes?????<br /><br />This is an addition to the original review and I have dropped it down from 4 stars to 3 stars based on further testing of the game.<br /><br />This game needs a help feature.  I FINALLY was able to access past \\"page 1\\" for the levels to pick up where I had ended before without having to redo puzzles.  I had to email the developer to find out you have to \\"drag\\" the page to the left to get the next page and to the right to get to the previous page.  I was able to get to page 4 to start in the 80s.<br /><br />There should be a next/previous button or some other indication of what to do -- including a help feature.<br /><br />That still puts this game at barely releasable but really still in beta.  I like beta testing (being an \\"active idiot\\") but I prefer to know beforehand!
