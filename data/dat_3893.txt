I unfortunately can not comment on the game play. I have the SRW Steering wheel and it is not supported in the software. I sent a inquiry to WRC4 and they provided a very limited list of gaming wheels that their software support. Don't make them same mistake I did, of purchasing a game that you are unable to play.
