You get the base game and the Season Pass. Supposedly, the Season Pass is supposed to come with all current DLCs and future DLCs, right? Nope! Not with this one. You don't get every single DLCs, which ruins the purpose of a Season Pass. I'd highly recommend everyone to stay away from these greedy developers on not making their fanbase happy when it comes to extra content.
