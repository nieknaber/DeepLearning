Ever since I watched Adam-12 and Dragnet reruns as a kid, I've always thought that a properly-executed \\"cop\\" open world game could be pretty awesome, and LA Noire delivers. Between the entertaining action bits (car chases, shootouts), evidence search and the fact you actually need to use logic and attention to detail to see a case through, it's a much more compelling game than your typical shooter or the GTA series really. The interrogations can be a little tough, even with the awesome facial recognition technology, it can be tough to get a read on witnesses/persons of interests. Definitely worth $10 for download if your PC can handle it.<br /><br />I have a Core i3, 4 gigs ram, and a GTX 560 with 1gig ram and it runs awesome.
