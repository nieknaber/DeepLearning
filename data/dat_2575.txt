If I could rate lower I would. My rate is so low because I didn't even get to experience the game. The digital copy, even when I placed an order for a physical one, never downloaded into my game menu; each time I downloaded it and it finished, it never showed up in the worlds tab. Never again wasting my time and money. I can't even get a refund.
