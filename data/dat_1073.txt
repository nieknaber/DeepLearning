What could have been fun and a great deal didn't work out in my situation, in spite of the fact that my configuration matches the \\"recommended\\".  First, be prepared for a wait as you download these--it'll take a while. After the download is complete, it's easy enough to run the installer.  ME1 installer worked okay, but the game did not play.  After a couple of crashes Win7 suggested a link to EA, where an update was available.  Downloaded the update and that eliminated the startup crash.  The update was made available in mid-2009!!!! For Heavens Sake, can we expect digital downloads to be a little more current?  We'll see how it goes from here.<br /><br />No such luck with ME2.  The installer stops with a \\"Data Error\\" which evidently is not an uncommon problem. After three hours of trying solution approaches discussed on the Bioware forum, no luck yet getting the install to work. Download 10.2 Gigs again? Amazon downloader evidently does not do a \\"data check\\" to confirm a successful download--It requires that it all be done again from scratch.  Maybe this wasn't such a bargain.<br /><br />UPDATE:  I decided to download the ME2 a second time using Amazon Downloader (overnight).  The install went smoothly this time, so the problem was evidently a data integrity issue with the downloader/downloaded file.  Suggestions seem to indicate that the EA/Origin downloader is more reliable.  Something to keep in mind.  Review changed to three stars-one subtracted for the ME1 missing update issued 2009 but not included in the download here, one subtracted for the Amazon downloader reliability.
