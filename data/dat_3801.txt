This game wouldn't install on my Windows 7 x64 at first either. So I looked the specific error code up online (this will usually solve 95% of problems). In my case it was an NSIS error and their website listed a simple work around that solved the issue. Took less than two minutes.<br /><br />I'm still learning this game but so far the graphics are great and I'm running a relatively low end laptop (Turion II P540, 4 gigs RAM, ATI Radeon HD4250). If I run into problems I'll come back and update this review.
