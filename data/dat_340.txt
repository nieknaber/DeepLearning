creative. original. flaky. it comes with the obligatory eco-message, but the game isn't centered around that. not too hard, not too easy. beautiful scenery and animation, and the music is rather good for a game. a certain kind of person might find it a little repetitious, and it's not for just anybody. but the vast variety of different trees you will grow and create keep it interesting. the main goal of the game is to revive this \\"magical land\\" by rediscovering the magical trees. you do this by crossbreeding trees, growing them from seeds, and protecting them from the elements. it is a simple system of play, but not without it's challenges. other features are unlocked along the way. i have really enjoyed the tree designing feature, which is easy to understand, but has a LOT of components that you can change, giving you lots of room for creativity. in my opinion it is well-designed and i have yet to experience a technical problem. there's lots of gameplay in it. but the dialogue is flaky. really flaky. really enjoyably flaky. lol.
