I always had qualms with the previous Civ V, mainly about the boring culture game and boring late-game. This expansion solved all of that for me. The World Congress is so game changing, and adds a rich layer to diplomacy. I never went for diplomatic victories before, but now they always seem to sneak up on me, due to how important the World Congress can be.<br /><br />Tourism is also a nice change to see. This adds to the culture victory, making it more offensive and inclusive. You have to act out to earn a culture victory now, rather than just sitting there in the late game and waiting to win.<br /><br />The new civs are also very amazing. I rarely play as the old ones anymore. Venice and the Shoshones are my new favorites. Followed by Morocco and the improved France.<br /><br />On a side note, I'd definitely purchase this code for steam, as opposed to the physical game. It's so much easier to have it on Steam, and much cheaper too!<br /><br />If you are a lover of Civ, this expansion only improves the gameplay, I'd DEFINITELY buy it!
