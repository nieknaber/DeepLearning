I actually enjoyed this a lot more than the orginal Borderlands and Borderlands 2. The environments were more varied and interesting and maneuvering in zero-G was fun and challenging. I also felt there was less run over here and get that, run back there and get that than in the others, but that may be because of the variety of landscapes.<br /><br />Some of the boss's Aussie accents can get pretty annoying, but that just might be because they were kicking my butt while yelling at me.
