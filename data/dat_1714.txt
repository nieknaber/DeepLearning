I played FF on the NES and the SNES, Playstation and PS2, and I have always loved it.  The initial process to actually get the game to work is horrible.  All I can say is that I hope it is worth it.  Adding 3 accounts to play a game is beyond ridiculous, and if I would have read the reviews I probably wouldn't have bought this from Amazon.  Unfortunately, I am now stuck in download/update hell.  This game should come with a warning from Amazon.  Maybe I will re-review in 8 hours.<br />*Update*  So, this is my final say... The game is terrible.  The graphics are horrible, even with a beefed up video card.  The UI is incomprehensible.  The whole experience was bad from start to finish.  Three accounts to play a sub-standard RPG is over the top.
