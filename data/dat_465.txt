I love the game, but it does have alot of bugs that should have been fixed since beta. Overall I still enjoy playing it.  If you have patience and can wait out the bug fixes then you should enjoy this game. If you have played any of the Elder Scrolls games, then you have a pretty good idea how this game is, its pretty much exactly the same. I love the world and quest, they are really fun and have really good storylines behind them.
