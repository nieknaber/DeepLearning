I'm an \\"older\\" gamer, so my eyes are what they used to be.  OK...I'm only 46, but still...my eyes aren't what they used to be.<br /><br />That is a problem with this game.<br /><br />I've never been a big shooter fan, but I do like to take a break from RPGs once in a while.  When I did most recently, I purchased Far Cry 3.  Awesome game.  I probably liked it because of its RPG elements, Skyrim-like open world, and play-it-as-fast-or-as-slow-as-you-like style.<br /><br />Then I saw Crysis 3 was coming out, liked the trailer videos, so preordered it.  I downloaded and installed when I was able, and started playing the day it went live.<br /><br />Graphics are awesome, no doubt.  The world is beautifully rendered, and runs smoothly on my liquid-cooled, overclocked i5 rig with GTX 670 FTW card, and the game mounted to a Samsung 830 SSD.  I have the settings maxed.<br /><br />The game play is more forgiving that the military-styled shooters I've played in the past, and it is far less confined to rails as many of those were as well, but it still felt like I had only one avenue available.  Weapon upgrades did give me a touch of RPG feel, but not enough to really win me over like Far Cry 3 did.  The pace is a little bit fast for me, also, and a tad unforgiving.  The environments are also pretty dark at times, and I have difficulty getting focused in on distant targets.  The visor HUD helps, but I'm often overrun before I can make effective use of it.  But that's OK for someone who likes the genre, but it's really not for me.  I'm about 2/3 of the way through, by my estimation, and I will finish it, but probably piece-meal over the next few months.<br /><br />If you're a shooter fan, I'd wager this game would be to your liking, especially if you like fast-paced affairs.  If you're like me and prefer RPG, or RPG/Shooter hybrids like Far Cry 3, you may not get the most enjoyment out of Crysis 3.  I don't regret spending the money, however.  I give the game a 3.5.
