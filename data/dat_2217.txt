This IS the world of Elder scrolls. This isn't some game produced by a third party to cash in on the franchise. This isn't just Skyrim with MMO added. Blown away by the detail. Visually stunning and correct. If you played Skyrim, Oblivion or earlier Elder scrolls games, you have no doubt you're in that world. The depth and number of quests are incredible. Cut them some slack for the lag in overcrowded spots like large cities, and the severs outs for updates and matinence, because this is a vital, constantly growing world to which they're adding dungeons weekly. Don't rush through this, don't just try to power level and see how fast you can get to the end. The wonder in this game is not in seeing how fast you can finish it, it's in exploring the details and quests in each new area that opens up. You'll love this even if you never played an MMO and are hesitant, if you liked Skyrim, Oblivion, Redquard or Daggerfall, you'll love Elder Scrolls Online..
