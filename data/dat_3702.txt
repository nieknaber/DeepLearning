It was very unclear what the $50 goes toward.  I was under the impression I was purchasing the 12 month X-Box On-Line membership where in fact it's only $50 towards Xbox.  At this time the Gift Card isn't working correctly when my son goes to purchase the X-Box On-Line through his X-Box.  It's just telling him it's a gift card and won't allow him to purchase it.
