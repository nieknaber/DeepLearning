Even without good multiplayer or replayability, this game holds merit and worth for the story alone. It breaks conventions and sucks you in with a fantastic plot that progresses well but leaves enough mystery that when you get to the ending you don't expect just how much of a toll the battles have taken on the main character psychologically. I'm trying hard not to give any spoilers because people should experience this game first hand. 4 stars for the actual gameplay, but it gets 5 just because of how fantastic the storytelling really is.
