wow i enjoyed figuring out how to download it more than i enjoyed playing it. there is no way this game has a 4 star rating. you have to be pretty bored to enjoy this game controls are all keyboard only and you will spend the 1st hour of play just figuring out what keys do what. dont get me wrong the game has potential but wow the programers should go back to school for some refresher courses.
