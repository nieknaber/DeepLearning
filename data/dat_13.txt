I sometimes get the impression that EA absolutely will not rest until they have destroyed gaming. And Sim City is the latest in the long line of of EA's weapons against people playing and enjoying games. Just no. If you buy this vile atrocity, you are part of the problem, supporting a company that only wishes to screw you, the consumer, as hard as it possibly can.<br /><br />Do not buy this game. I plead with you.
