I had purchased this game for my son who thought it was hilarious.. you get a variety of different bowling balls to choose from and the zombies change form every now and then to keep things interesting...  its a fun game to pass the time. Its not gory at all...  Its a great game for the cheap price i paid...as long as you have the Amazon games and softward downloader - you are good to go.. it was up and running in a matter of seconds..
