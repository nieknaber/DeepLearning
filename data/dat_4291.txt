This game is just terrible. Black flag is not going to be better. The single player is completely disappointing. Remember all those cool hype trailers that got you excited for the game? The stuff that looked like gameplay? Nope, sorry. Not in the game. I don't want to get started on the multiplayer, but since this is a review, I will. Describe it in one word? Ok, \\"broken.\\" This is interchangeable with awful, aggravating, s***ty, or rigged. It barely worked ever, and it's no wonder that they lost their player base within months. I hope that someone sees this before they make the mistake that I did. It is quite unfortunate that the Assassins Creed development team is so inferior to the teams working on FarCry and Splinter Cell. I only wish that I had made this review sooner, and I apologize to all who purchased this game.
