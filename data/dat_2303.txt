This is piece of garbage,i had the same problems as the other reviewer with the controller never mind it forced me to use the keyboard to play,then it paused/froze every 30secs or so for about 15secs then go and i'm wrecking into a truck that was 1/4mile ahead of me.this is the worst $11 i have ever spent.maybe i should have bought a $10 piece of crack and a can soda,i would have had more fun and,i don't smoke.    btw they get 1 star because i can't rate it a 0 star        PISSED  Eric  S.
