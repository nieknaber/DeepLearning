Its hard to fully express how disappointed I was with this game.  Having loved Port Royale 2, and spent hundreds, if not thousands of hours playing that game, I was super excited to find out that a Port Royale 3 was coming out.  I found out two days before it came out, and got 15% off by pre-ordering the game.  The first game I think I have ever pre-ordered.  Even at a discount, it's not worth the money.<br /><br />  Ever seen a video game get a face lift?  That's basically what this was.  Another old time favorite game of mine, Deadlock, by the now bankrupt and gone Accolade, did the same thing.  Produced a great game with Deadlock, and years later released Deadlock 2, which was identical to Deadlock 1, except for different menu colors, and re-done animations.  Nothing new was added, no new gameplay, no new missions, dont even think the music changed.  Very similar thing has happened here.  The company that made Port Royale 2 is bankrupt and gone, and this is more like a digitally remastered version of PR2 than an actual sequel to PR2.<br /><br />  Port Royale 3.  They did change the music.  The music is decent.  That may be the only compliment in here about this game.  The ships are the same, the towns are the same, the goods are the same.  Granted, there's a lot of things that wouldn't make sense if they changed, like the name and/or location of a town; and I'm not expecting sub-marines to be available at the shipyard alongside wooden sloops.  But... come on, if there is nothing new in the game, why am I buying it?  There were no additional ship designs that could be offered, or a way to customize ships, or smaller towns that could be added alongside the existing larger towns ?<br /><br />  PR2, you had 19 different commodities that you could trade.  PR3 has 20.  Of the 19 in PR2, 17 of them have made it back in PR3.  The interface for buying the goods is actually worse in PR3.  In PR2 you could click a button allowing you to buy items by 1s, 10s, or 100s.  In PR3, its a slider bar, slides by 1s up to 10, then by 2s, then by 5s.  Its very annoying, and very fickle to deal with.<br /><br />  So the goods and ships are the same, no big deal right?  The missions are the same too.  Hunt down this person for revenge, find my lost boy, rescue your missing wife.  IF you've played PR2, you've done all these missions a hundred times.  Maybe since I've done them a hundred times already, is why they have no appeal now.<br /><br />  Face Lift:  Most of the core items still exist exactly as they were in Port Royale 2.  It wouldn't surprise me if they used the same code, added new music, and enhanced the graphics.  The graphics 'OVERALL' are much better than in PR2. Let me emphasize that while I think overall they are better, its not better everywhere, ie. across the board.  In PR2, all of the important characters, wife, viceroy, governors, townspeople who would hire you, and the chronicler, all had animated video clips.  Video and Sound to tell you your mission, or ask your help.  In PR3, only the advisor gets video clips, everyone else is just a quick sound clip with a still picture.  The characters no longer tell you your mission either; they say \\"I have an offer for you\\", and then you have to read the proposal.  The towns are beautiful High Def graphics, yet all the buildings are the same color, and hard to differentiate when you are in town.<br /><br />  Other things of note:  The overall interface of the game is worse.  The slider bar becomes real annoying real quick.  Transferring items and/or ships between convoys is more annoying and cumbersome than before.  Checking convoy status is harder to get to, and even with the campaign and multiplayer put in, It feels like more was taken out from PR2, than was put in to PR3;  why was the gambling card game at the Tavern removed?  why were the mission success videos taken out?<br /><br />Bottom Line:  I have a hard time giving this game 1 star, it seems really harsh.  Yet, 2 stars feelslike way more than it deserves.  I'm giving it 2 stars with the following advice.  Anyone who has played Port Royale 2, is going to be severely disappointed with this game.  Anyone who hasn't, you'd be better off saving some money and getting Port Royale 2, which you'll probably like better anyhow.
