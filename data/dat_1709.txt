It advertises this as &#34;Microsoft points&#34; but when I entered the code on Microsoft.com, it said I had zero points.  When we signed into the xbox we had Microsoft money...but no points.  So we had to use the Microsoft money to then buy the points.  Other than the small inconvenience, my son got what he needed with Microsoft points.
