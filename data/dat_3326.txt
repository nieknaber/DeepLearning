I waited for quite some time for seasons to come out for the sims 3. So I was very disappointed when after installing the game would freeze or I would see a black screen.<br />At first I found that my laptop is not good enough to play it, even though it was just over 1 year old. So i found an amazing deal on a laptop with a discrete graphic card. Thinking it now would work, I installed it again. Unfortunately it gave me the same problem.<br />This expansion is not fog me!!
