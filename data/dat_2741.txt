No crashes, no bugs, no blue screens, no freezes, no CPU Crashes, nothing! Takes a while to set up though, but does not take long to download nor install! Only thing is if you have a laptop - make sure you have a fan because this program makes your laptop fan and cooling system work, especially for the MacBook Pro - otherwise, flawless!
