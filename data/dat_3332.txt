This is the most gorgeous Hidden Object Game I have ever seen. I own tons of this genre of games and I have never seen a more beautifully designed video game.  Nora Roberts is one of my favorite authors. I was a bit leery of what this game would be like.  I should have known that anything Ms.Roberts was involved with would be fabulous.  There is nothing available that matches this game. Please keep this series going. It's too beautiful to be the only one of it's kind available.  Kudos to Ms. Roberts for such an awesome entry into the video game world.
