I have a long  history with SOTS2. Preordered it, then tried several times to get into it.Lets forget the first months where it was near unplayable, but even when it got stable, it just didnt keep my interest to even finish half a game. Until i retried around 2-3 months ago (~june 2013).This time the game sucked me in tottaly, and i truly beleive its a good game now with still a potential to be great.<br /><br />Pros:<br />+Incredible scope and depth.Each race plays different , genious and big tech tree with the feasibilty studies mechanic,sips designs,real time combat, random encounters, grand menaces... The way all the techs/gouvernemts/ship design/trading/real time battles mesh together gives you 100 ways to create new tactics and strategies.<br /><br />+Beatifull graphics in battle.<br /><br />+There is no simple paper/scissor/rock mechanics. Each weapon/module got different strenghts, and might be better in different situations.<br /><br />+Increadible mp.If you happen to find a good player for mp , the experience is unlike anything i have experienced in my 10 years of gameing.The tactics,deceits, counters  you end up trading with your opponents are incredible.Example:In my current MP game i am behind in tech but ahead in economy.What i did was throw just enough fleets at my opponent to keep him busy, and sneaked my weaker fleet behind his lines, to attack his undefended money making worlds (scouted earlier).I could tell 100 of stories like that<br /><br />+Great lore.<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />-+ Its rather for a hardcore strategy player, its not easy to learn the game.As mentioned the game is huge which is mainly good but also have the drawback of being intimidating at first.<br /><br />-+ AI is still just decent.(Its NOT bad as it was before).IF you get to know the game  good, you might loose any real challenge in playing the AI, forcing you to mp.(Kerberos is still working on AI tough so there is hope for future)<br /><br />-End turns performance.This isstill a huge pain. On big maps end turns can take more then a minute on even decent computers. Im playing maps up to 4 players so i can have fast end turns (below 20 seconds)<br /><br />-Some minor featerus seem still not fully implemented.<br /><br />-Minor bugs<br /><br />All in all i would recommend it for turn based strategy fans that like complicated games, you sould be happy. And while its in its current state good, with Kerberos still working on it, it might some day become a great game.
