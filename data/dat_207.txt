Base game didn't offer much activities and doesn't offer with many design options. Create-A-Sim is better and is probably the best in terms of customization. However Customization falls flat with no Create-A-Style. What it lacks in design options packs a big punch in building options, long time simmers who enjoying building and architecture will be pleased. The biggest thing with The Sims whole existence is sim interaction and it isn't really here with this game. Sim social interactions take a very long time to build. The lack of nonsocial and social options is one of the biggest turn offs in terms of gameplay. The quirky, freaky and wild interactions are completely gone from past sim games in this. It is almost sterile  and &#34;too clean&#34; with the same sim &#34;emotions&#34; and activities and interactions. Almost to the point where is becomes boring and unoriginal. Open world is gone with this and it is very annoying to have loading screens. Overall this game had much potential to be better and offer more as a base game but failed to deliver. This game is more of a good  for new simmers but long time players won't be pleased with bugs, glitches and lacking content. I would hope that in the next DLC for the game it will have all these missing things or similar elements I have mentioned in the future. I would highly recommend going back to The Sims 3 as this games reverts back in development and game progression to almost what feels like The Sims 2 or Sim City 5.
