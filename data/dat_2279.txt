I think this tank simulateor is the most historically accurate most vissualy apealing I have ever seen. Do not pass it up if you are in any way interested in world war two.Dammage effects are great weapon sounds and accuracey seem real.EVERYTHING seems real.The only downfall is that if you are interested in mods most of them (if you are an english vershion downloader) are in Russian.But it is still possible to get a translated mod.You just have to look for them.By the way the soundtrack for the intro vidieo is not the best.
