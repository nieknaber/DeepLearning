Decent MMORPG, but kinda a bad Final Fantasy game. Is nothing like 11, if you played that. Took on a LOT of characteristics of a normal MMORPG, and lost a lot of the characteristics that make a game a Final Fantasy game.<br /><br />Classes/Jobs are a bit strange, and the lore behind them can be... befuddled. The mage classes kinda of suck, especially black mage. Black mage is supposed to use the elements against their target to do massive damage depending on their weakness, however in this game there are no elemental weaknesses, your Fire spell does the same damage to a plant as it does to Ifrit (you know, the god of fire?) You also only get fire, blizard, and thunder. White mage uses Wind, Water (gets ONE spell) and earth, but still uses 'protect' instead of a spell like Aero from KH, and can solo REALLY easily. The classes all kind of suck.<br /><br />Not really worth the $15 a month, either.<br /><br />Crafting can be interesting, and having your own room within your FC house is fun to decorate.<br /><br />The graphics are AMAZING.<br /><br />Decent MMORPG, but as a Final Fantasy game it's one of the worst.<br /><br />Has a super nice community, too!
