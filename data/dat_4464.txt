The direct download was very easy and inexpensive.  The game play with keyboard is kind of hard to handle especially after playing GTA 4 on PS3.  I tried a generic game controller for the pc which was recognized and functioned on the pc but wouldn't work with the game.  Very disappointed in control of PC version but for the price and game play it was hard to be overly disappointed.  That is why I gave it a high review.
