Don't ignore the other other reviews on this one- this game is broken! Even when run on a system well above minimum spec, no matter how many times we attempted to update or re-install it just wont' work. Getting past the opening the title screen won't happen because the auto-updater intoduces corupt files that keep the game from playing. Since relesae Rockstar have released a few suggestions on getting it to run, but those instructions are too painful to complete for those looking to simply enjoy the game they thought was purchased.<br /><br />Apparently Rockstar has made the downloadable fix available to those who have purchaed LA Noire from Steam. Do yourself a favor and buy it, if you must, from there. However, dadly, the tradition of making an an easily downloadable patch available fom their website apparently won't be going forward. I'm truly disappointed that Amazon continues to sell this game as a download without addressing these well documented problems. Rockstar should also be faulted for barely moving on the issue through their own customer support channels. Again, where is the functioning patch?<br /><br />DO NOT BUY THIS GAME FROM AMAZON! IT IS VERY MUCH BROKEN!
