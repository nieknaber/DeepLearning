Whether you are a casual or hardcore gamer, Playstation Plus has something for you.<br /><br />Besides cloud save and weekly discounts, it offers wide, rotating catalogue of games for its members. It reminds me of the columbia house record club, except the entire selection is outstand (characterized by the high metacritic score) and included in the low membership fee.<br /><br />I've had plus since its debut (or shortly afterwards), but I haven't really changed my buying habits. On duplicates, it gives me a convenient digital version for games I either frequently play (e.g. Battlefield 3 and Borderlands 2) or own on steam (e.g. Bioshock Infinite and XCOM). Otherwise, it introduces me to games that I would not have bought otherwise (e.g. Outlast, Metro: Last Light).<br /><br />If you have a Vita, PS3, or PS4 (even more so if you have more than one of those) and don't have plus, you really don't know what you are missing.
