The single player part of this game is fun.  There are many good aspects, although not perfect, great for the price.  I can never get enough of the horse riding combat, and the AI is surprisingly.  The graphics aren't cutting edge, but I was able to overlook that easily for the good game play.  I highly recommend the Diplomacy mod for this game.  It is a true enhancement.<br /><br />I have not got into the multiplayer part of the game.
