I purchased this game. However it will not download. I spent a half an hour on the phone with PS customer service, only for them to realize the code that I was given is not valid. I am really pissed. If amazon can reconcile the situation, I will give this comment an update that is based on the actual game, not my terrible experience.    UPDATE: Amazon refunded my offer. That was cool.    Anyway, the game is awesome. I would give it five stars but only because I have some nostalgia attached to the title. It is really not that great of a game though, so... four stars.
