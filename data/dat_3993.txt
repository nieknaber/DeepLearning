I was impressed with the reviews I've seen for this game, both professional and user reviews. However, seeing all the problems for people with Nvidia cards, I decided to wait on  my purchase.<br /><br />Well, today an official game update patch was released (version 1.0.722.3)and Nvidia realeased a beta driver update (314.21).<br /><br />I thought I would let people know, who might have been waiting on patches like I was. Just purchased it, and excited to get it downloaded and give it a go.<br /><br />Edit (The next day) : I've played about an hour into the game now, and find it really enjoyable. When you do this type of game right, it can really shine. The graphics and sound are wonderful. I know some people say \\"graphics don't matter, it's the gameplay\\", but would Jurassic Park be the same movie if it was a bunch of guys dressed up in dinosaur costumes yelling \\"ROAR\\"...because it's all about the story, right? The game is a great package from what little I've seen so far. I'm not the biggest fan of the action sequences where you hit the right button at the right time, but in this game it's not so bad. Like I said earlier, done right. The atmosphere the developers created in game is spot on, and pulls you into the story well. One hour into game, and my rating went from 4 stars to 5 stars.<br /><br />TL/DR - If you want to play and experience the origin movie of Lara Croft instead of sitting around watching it in a theater, this game is for you. New game build and Nvidia drivers let 600 series cards play with no problems (at least for me, max settings, 1920x1200, avg 54 fps, no crashes, gtx 690)
