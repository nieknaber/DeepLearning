Alan Wake is truly a unique gaming experience. The story line is tremendously well-done. It's very suspenseful and scary at times. Essentially it is a shooter with a great story and tremendous graphics. But there are very different types of tasks throughout the game. It can go from a very easy 3 or so enemies at one turn, then the next is a whole hoard! It's cool that they've already come out with a new chapter with American Nightmare. This is a game I can definitely see replaying again! I've definitely been converted to the Action genre after being more of a shooter fan. I love this game, Bioshock, Prototype, Batman, etc. They bring a good mix of action with good story lines. In most shooters, I just skip the story to get to the action, but not with Alan Wake!
