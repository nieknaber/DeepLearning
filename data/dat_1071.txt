Dead Island is full of bugs and problems to this day. The story is also shallow and boring. Luckily these issues are mostly fixed in its sequal Dead Island Riptide. The story of riptide also fills you in on what happened in the first game so you don't even need to play the original to know what's going on.<br /><br />Tldr; Buy Dead Island Riptide instead.
