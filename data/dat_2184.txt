the mouse pointer is not lined up with the tile you try to select...it's off about an inch. To choose new lay out, tile sets, and backgrounds you don't get nice little thumbnail pics of the options...the names are listed and you have to click on an item in the list in order to see a preview. It makes it very tedious and kills my desire to want to play the game. I want to be able to scroll through mini pics to choose all my options with as few clicks as possible. Very disappointed.
