The sims 3 pets was great the first week or so I used it. After that, the dogs, cats, and sims were fine, just some glitches. Whenever I clicked on the horse though, it would always freeze up before I could do anything. I would have to shut down my macbook pro. I rated this a three star because I could play with the horse, but not as the horse. As in my sim could still ride her, feed her, clean her, ect. but I couldn't play as the horse. Again the other animals were fine, I could play as them and all. I hope this helped you!!
