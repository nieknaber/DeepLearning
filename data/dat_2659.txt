I have already spent a few hours playing this game. :) I appreciate that you can finish a level in a while when you don't have much time or you can spend a lot of time playing a large map when you are bored at home or at work :) I especially enjoy local multiplayer with my boyfriend (because he is not as good as me :) ) or with my friends. It is a great fun, you can steal their goods or attack them.
