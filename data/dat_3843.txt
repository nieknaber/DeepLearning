this game is junk. the graphics don't make up for the fact that they took away 3d and the ability to toggle flat land. the maps are super small, with no real ability to expand beyond estates. they got rid of so many things that made crusader fun. i waited for 12 yrs to get shafted. i want my money back. it sucks and there is piratically no one playing multiplayer online. Also don't believe you can play this game inside your own intranet, they've removed that feature by forcing steam down your throat. junk pure and simple
