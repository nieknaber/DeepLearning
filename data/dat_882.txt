Xbox Live points are a great gift idea and should be a smooth buy on Amazon. But if you order them with the intent to use immediately, beware. I don't like having to enter my card number at each purchase but it's required. Then since I ordered them recently and chose to purchase again, it took 4+ hours to verify my information. Um, I'm ordering points to use now? Checking the site and email over several hours for my code was annoying. Yes, it's done for security reasons but that's why I enter my Amazon password. After the second 'delayed' purchase, I decided to use Paypal to buy points through my Xbox console.
