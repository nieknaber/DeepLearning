So i bought this game because i heard about it when it came out and im not much of a game player but i wanted to play something and thought of this. well i got the game for pc and the shipping was fast. it was great i got it in like 2 days. so when i went to download the game it was successful everything worked great but when i went to open the game to play it. IT WONT OPEN. i was and am still frustrated with this game. i really wanted to play it. im kid of sad it didnt work but i guess it just wasnt ment to be. Other then that it downloaded nicely and got here fast
