BAD!<br /><br />It does not follow your instructions for where to install it.  I had to google to figure out HOW to find where it was placed.<br /><br />It ignores settings from session to session and is incredibly difficult to even start the game.<br /><br />This game is lasting on my computer not much longer than it's taken to write this review.  It's GONE!
