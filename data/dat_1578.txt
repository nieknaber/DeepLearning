I love this great game and have both versions.  I can't stop playing!  The graphics are fantastic and the sound effects and movement in the explosions are thrilling!  This is a match type game that at times you can match even 10 at once.  There is also a fairytale story involved but for the most part a match game.  Love the beautiful opening screen where the wizard awaits you.  Can't go wrong with this game!
