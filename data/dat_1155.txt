Game is fun, but every time I play a little the servers disconnect and I lose my work.  I had 46k citizens at one point then it crashed and when I reloaded it was back to 18k.  Lost all the infrastructure work done during that time as well.<br /><br />If you do get on, don't claim another city on the same map for fear you'll crash and lose the active city's work.<br /><br />Very slow to load even when servers are online.<br /><br />City zones are very small so switching cities in a map is necessary but with the crashing, it's a major risk to do.<br /><br />If you want to buy this game, I'd wait a while until all this pans out.  I've yet to see an \\"always on\\" DRM system work that didn't punish the actual customers.  Wait until people give up out of frustration or EA provides more servers before spending your money.<br /><br />Wish I would have not spent the $60.  :(
