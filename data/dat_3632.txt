Ok lets start out, after spending about 6-7 hours pouring over my computer trying to figure out what was wrong, I finally figured out how to get this thing to work. I was so happy for it to finally work, and the game window even pulled up asking which game I wanted to play. At that point I would have given it a good 4 stars, but here comes the worst part. When I started the game up the next morning, a screen wouldn't even come up. When I looked deeper into the problem, it said that my GRAPHICS were not good enough. It did not say anything on the product description about graphics! So I just wasted 20 bucks, but I have Grand Theft Auto 4 on my PS3. I bought this game simply for the mods. Its a bummer that it didn't work, but the world isn't perfect. Amazon, please state the graphics.
