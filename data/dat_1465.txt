This is the first experience I have had with Tropico, after being a fan of Sims and Civilization for several years I thought I might try something new. I have to say Tropico is buggy, not user friendly at all. It does offer a a beautiful background, personalization for presidente, and the ability to build a city. However meeting the 'tasks' and building, especially the roads, can be difficult, if not impossible at times, and connecting areas across islands is next to impossible. I searched like crazy trying to find fixes to some of these issues without success. I uninstalled the game in the end and won't be playing again. I can tell a lot of people like the game so I don't want to put less stars, as for me it didn't hold me attention well and was more frustrating than fun.
