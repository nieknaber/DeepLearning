I have only played two Final Fantasy games.  This one and the first one that was remade for the Gameboy Advance a few years ago.  I have to say that everybody video game fan has to play this game at least once.  This is one of the best games of all time.  I am not even a RPG fan but the storyline is really deep and interesting and character development is phenomenal.  The only thing about games like this is that you have to grind or develop your character if you really want to beat it.  That will definitely take several hours to do.  I played and beat this game years ago when it came out for the original Playstation and playing this game was great to re-live those days. This is pretty much an exact replica of the original game. I like the fact that you can change the controller configuration to your liking and that the games saves to the cloud so you can download and start the game where you left off on any computer.  I highly recommend this game.
