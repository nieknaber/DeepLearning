While the game is fun when I am playing - the launch has been THE WORST I have ever seen.  Over the last week, I have been able to play maybe a total of 4 hours.  They keep saying they are going to increase the number of people that can play - but that has NOT happened yet - in fact, things have gotten WORSE over time.  For example, all day today (Saturday, August 31st) - I have not been able to log in at all.  Overall - I wish I had never wasted my money on this game.
