This game was enjoyable as a diversion for a couple of days, but I found the Hidden Object format very repetitive and wouldn't want to make a habit of it.  Some of the other puzzles could have been better explained; wound up skipping a couple of them when I tried every combination I could think of, and they still wouldn't cooperate.  Good plot line, though.
