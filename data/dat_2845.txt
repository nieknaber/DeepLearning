Have put more than 400 hours into the multiplayer, which after patch 1.4 is exceptional. (play on DDD servers, everything else is meh). The single player is graphically impressive but suffers from several major flaws, such as an unfinished campaign. The beginning 3 hours are in my opinion better than Crysis or Crysis 2. However, the end was severely underdeveloped. (just look at level design) In the end, the multiplayer makes up for this. This is my PERSONAL opinion.
