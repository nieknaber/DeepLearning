The game was developed by the worst programmers I have EVER bought a game from. Seriously this game is BUGGY. Not only does the game have a TON OF problems, but Bethesda has done literally NOTHING to rectify them. Thankfully, the private market has developed some patches and other mods to make the game better. I did get a lot of play time out of it, so since I paid $15 for the game plus 3 expansions, it's fine. The scenery in some locations is absolutely BEAUTIFUL, but the characters are like low quality World of Warcraft from 10 years ago. Also, the gameplay itself is pretty lacking. Selecting your spells and powers is clunky as they expect you to pause the game in the middle of your fight if you want to use more than 1 spell. You can put 8 things on hotkeys (number keys), but they often times either don't work or just randomly switch to something else.<br /><br />The game has HUGE potential, but not in the hands of this horrible developer.
