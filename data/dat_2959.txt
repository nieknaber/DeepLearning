Not the best in the series, and the story takes a rather........ surreal presence, even for a video game, let alone one of the Assassin's Creed franchise.<br /><br />Still, it is a good addition, Especially in seeing the finale' of the Ezio saga. Being one that has carried the series to knew heights all it's own. Definitely a worth addition.
