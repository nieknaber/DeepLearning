I bought this because I absolutely love to play adventure games.  Many reviews were quite favorable.  I found the story overly simplistic.  The graphics very poor and cartoon like.  The navigation was nearly impossible.  It was more of a chore than a pleasure to play.  I had no sense of wanting to find out what happens next.  Sure wish I could get a refund.
