No problems with Windows Vista on a Dell XPS M1730.  This is one of the best game series ever created.  I love them all.  I especially appreciate the fact that the developers are always open to including new types of game play (like solitaire and hidden object).  For the cost of a free trial download, you should try all the Jewel Quests.
