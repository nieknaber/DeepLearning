Purchased for my son.  I placed Season Pass on my primary account and it did not share to his account on same PS3 Console.  First time this has ever happened to any game or DLC I've ever purchased.  I contacted Activision (twice) as well as PSN... unfortunately... they just tell me their hands are tied... but would probably love to sell me another DLC Season Pass.  Not going to happen!  My son will not be playing Activision games in the future if I can help it.
