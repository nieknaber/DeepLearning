This is a lot of fun but it has a lot of glitches.  Whatever you do don't take of the full screen.  I did and it minimized it.  It stayed minimized and I can't get it to come up so I can get the full screen off.  This makes it totally useless.  I have tried reloading but it doesn't help.  It tends to shut itself off for no reason too.
