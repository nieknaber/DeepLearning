I have been playing the Battlefield series since Battlefield 2.  Battlefield 4 is by far the best in the series.  I never much got into BF3, not entirely sure why, but I've been playing BF4 since the public beta.  I very much enjoy the recon class, and really like the fact I can now zero my scope, rather than guessing.  Also, having access to the laser rangefinder, gives me exact distances to targets.  My new favorite is the MAV, I love flying around spotting enemies for my team, plus I know when enemies are headed my way.  I like that I can disable, and destroy enemy gadgets, such as radio beacons, and especially explosives, C4 and Claymores.  I've managed approx 12 kills to date blowing up an enemies own exposives. The counter knife is a great new addition, but I would like to see something added for countering while prone.  (Unless, I just haven't got the hang of it yet.  I do miss the .50cal, but at least it is a pickup weapon.  I also think this is the first time I have liked all of the sniper rifles.  But, I do miss the auto spot scope from Bad Company... Much easier than continuing to hit \\"Q.\\"  I'm still trying to improve my skills, but I'm getting better every time I play.  I would like to see some of the older maps become available in BF4, but, so far I am enjoying the current map rotation...  Keep up the good work.... Please continue your tradition of updating the game as needed.
