\\"This is one journey you will never forget.\\" First of i must say this game was hyped and my expectations were enormous.<br />That said I honestly did not feel connect at all with both brothers nor did i find the storytelling that impressive(it's good) as some critics made it out to be. The world is gorgeous and feels fleshed out. The puzzles are lacklustre...not once did i feel challenged with one of the puzzles. This game leans heavily on it's story and you being emotionally attached to the brothers, i was not.  What was left is a predictable story and linear game where you hit invisible walls when going slightly of the pad . I was left disappointed when the credits rolled. Though it is not a bad game at all, i would give it a 6/10 and deserves a playthrough. Which will last 3 hours if you take your time. Not worth the full price.
