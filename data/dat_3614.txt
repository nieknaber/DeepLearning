Plagued with a tiny town<br /><br />Cannot play offline<br /><br />Even more Advanced-DRM<br /><br />Buggy with a lot of flaws<br /><br />Overall this game has been poorly designed and is almost exact replica of it's predecessor with minor changes and a graphical face-life.<br /><br />Do yourself a favor and buy something else. I would personally recommend DmC: Devil May Cry as I find it a descent reboot.<br /><br />Cheers!
