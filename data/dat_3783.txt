One of the main draws of advertisement was the amazing detail in the animations and with mine the diplomats are still frame. I don't know if that was the game itself or just my copy. I also don't like the game play, that's just my opinion, it's too tedious and extremely repetitive. The outcome is a little interesting each time but you do the same thing to get there. Otherwise it's a well thought out game that had its reputation built too high for clear judgement.
