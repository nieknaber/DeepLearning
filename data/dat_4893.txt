I am a hidden object game addicted. And it is really hard to find alot that are actually entertaining. To me this game was totally worth it. I first did the 30 minute trial and after the 30 minutes I was sad that it had ended. So of course I decided to buy it. It was a little short, but other than that I don't have anything negative to say.
