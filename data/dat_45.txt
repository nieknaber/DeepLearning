I purchased this test as my friend told me it was a great product. Well I downloaded and did the test right away. I didn't fare well because if you don't pay attention to the test itself, you will fail. 1 test is crack the egg, so I kept hitting the shell and it broke to much and the yoke fell out. The other one was Don't push the red button. You are flying along, thinking I'am on a roll, then the red button. Since you are pressing yellow, orange and other colors all the time, my brain said push it, FAIL< FAIL, restart. Great game and a great price. I bought one for my Grandson who is 12 and he just loves it.
