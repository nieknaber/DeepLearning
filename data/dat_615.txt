It definitely lives up to the Civilization legacy and is a better edition and upgrade than Civ IV was (For sure!!!). The graphics are pretty cool too, and although some may think it excessive, I think it's about the coolest thing ever! The only downside is that it did not run well on my 4GB, Window 7, Core i5 laptop (may it rest in peace after an motherboard blowout 2 years later) - It ran hot and slow even in 2-D mode. It wasn't exactly an Alienware, but it was supposed to fit requirements. (the previous performance on my 4GB, Vista, ATI*** definitely doesn't count!) I understand that the algorithms and coding get pretty complex, but couldn't you make it a little more smooth? Laptops don't have the dissipation to run it well, but a tower shouldn't have trouble.<br /><br />About the gameplay: The only thing negative that I can come up with is about the nukes. I would have been happier if they localized SDI by making it a building and toning down its effectiveness maybe 10% or so after each attempted nuke per turn or something like that. If you still want to include the SDI satellite, make it a separate tech and national wonder with a slower effectiveness decrease. Nukes are being programmed for SDI evasion now, so SDI will never render them truly obsolete. The nukes didn't need to be nerfed - SDI needed to be fixed.<br /><br />Random thought: maybe there should be a building for mass producing a specific unit, etc. and have to destroy it before you produce anything else.<br /><br />Bottom line: I give it four to counter-balance all the fan-boys giving a five for the name.
