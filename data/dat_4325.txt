How come? To say that Crysis 2 is \\"worst than the original\\" really means that first Crysis was a bad game.   The correct words should say \\"not as good as the original\\" when in fact, even this corrected afirmation is not entirely true.   The first Crysis may be considered a different beast. Realistic graphics, lots of visual customization, realistic physics, complex gameplay, sandbox type levels. But it was a resource hog!     Crysis 2 is a true sequel to an outstanding game that was and still is ahead of its time.     Crysis 2 has a new story, gameplay, enviroment and technology based on what the first one offered, making it accesible to new players, while at the same time keeping familiar elements for Crysis fans. Fans of the game and not fans of a \\"overpowered benchmark app\\"     If you want to play a \\"new\\" Crysis, without changing \\"anything\\", then you have Warhead. Oh, wait, that is not a sequel! It's just more of the same! oops!!!     Crytek have acomplished and delivered with Crysis 2. They will not let this franchise nor they company to die and dissapear just to keep pleasing a bunch of guys that liked to say \\"Dude, MY machine runs Crysis at its fullest and yours can't, I'm so cool\\". This might be the same kind of guys that played \\"hardcore\\" FLIGHT SIMULATIONS. And were are that kind of games, and the companies that created them, anymore?     So, thanks crytek for giving us Crysis 2, making it more mainstream and show to the console kids that OUR Crysis is WAY cooler than any Halo game ;)
