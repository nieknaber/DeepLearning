Fighting games that support more than 2 players have been on my radar since Wu Tang - Shaolin Style.  I own a bunch of expensive games, and I find myself playing this every night.      The graphics are cool, but the fighting action is a bit of a button masher (until you get the hang of it).  However the different challenges really keep it interesting.  The storyline is non-existent, but if I want a story I read a book.    Bottom line:  BUT THIS GAME!
