The Good:<br />-The game is quite fun as far as action pack goes for a few minutes with its hack-n-slash attacks that you must constantly use.<br />-The different skins for the units help detract from the obvious issue with limited comestic options with goods.<br />-Each character is unique in his/her own way and helps add something for each player.<br />-All characters have their own strengths and weaknesses and one is not better than the other.<br /><br />The Bad:<br />-The archer obviously sucks early on, and that causes issues with newer players (lucky for me, I did not start with her), and with her being the only ranged unit that isnt magic, that could be a downer for some.<br />-The game is NOT a single player and runs through Steam or some other Online program that I forgot the name for (That being said, I would NOT buy it from Amazon as Steam is always cheaper, especially around holidays). That being said, it becomes impossible after level 1 to play single player, and that can cause issues since hosts randomly disconnect due to no fault of their own at times. Even so, the game becomes increasingly hard with too many people.<br /><br />The Ugly:<br />-After a while, it gets boring. Run around, kill things, go back to the crystal hope it isnt under attack, run back, upgrade towers, get the mana before the mage gets it...ugh. Therefore, I recommend it for casual play like Solitaire or Chess, but that is about it.<br /><br />Overall: It is Okay for about $20 with all the DLCs.
