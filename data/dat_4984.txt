First off, I understand that problems can arise. However, the launch of SimCity is truly a massive joke. We've all essentially paid for a game that should still be in beta testing. Of course, their \\"beta test\\" consisted of 1 hour play periods. Too controlled to really see if there were any problems.<br /><br />I have not yet been able to load the game today. To be fair, I was able to play nearly all day yesterday, with \\"only\\" 10 or 15 disconnects. Once you're in, you quickly see that you can't actually build a large city. The map sizes are all very small.<br /><br />I really hope for the best. I'll give EA a week or two to get this straightened out. If they don't, I'll ask for a refund. If they won't refund, I'll have my credit card company issue a charge back.
