Pro:<br />1) The trade/economic side of the game is as good a business sim as any tycoon game out there with nuanced economics and several industries to develop.<br /><br />Cons:<br />1) Soulless sailing accomplished via setting waypoints, automated boarding and sword fighting during battles, and robotic plot advancement which requires level-grinding and sucks the fun out of playing.<br />2) relatively complex interface and the aforementioned nuanced game mechanics require an hours-long tutorial to pick up--consider it an investment in the game.  It will take a while for it to get fun, but there's plenty of replay value on the trade and production side of the game.<br /><br />---------------------------------------------------------------------<br />I'm a huge fan of Sid Meier's Pirates!--both the 2004 remake and the original from the 80s.  I saw this on steam and picked it up thinking it was similar to SMP, but updated and more nuanced.  I was wrong.<br /><br />While SMP was about sailing and fighting and courting the governors' daughters, this game is about trade and building a commercial empire.  While the ability to plant roots by building plantations and workshops in towns is a huge plus, the actual sailing and fighting is much more automated than in SMP--more like Empire: Total War, and lacked soul or fun.<br /><br />I suppose people don't get simulation games for simplicity, but SMP's entire interface can be managed with the number pad.  My four year old figured out how to play in a few minutes.  Port Royale's tutorial took 8 hours for me to complete (although some of that was because the AI didn't detect that I had completed the objective, so I had to repeat it--another minor issue).<br /><br />Overall, if you want to sail the Caribbean, hunting pirates and amassing a fortune as a privateer, you'll have a more enjoyable time with Sid Meier's Pirates!  If you are interested in building a commercial empire while your captains and crew do all the sailing and fighting, look no further than Port Royale 2.
