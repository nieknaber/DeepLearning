This game changed First person shooters for me. I have always been a full supporter of multiplayer shooters like Call Of Duty and Halo, but the campaign for this game is amazing. Everything from the graphics to the story-line in this game is flawless. I have beaten it several times and on every difficulty and the game is never gotten old. So if your sick of the run of the mill first person shooters, and want a game that has a huge replay value, get this game because you will not regret it.
