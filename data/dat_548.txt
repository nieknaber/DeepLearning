like the title said, EA offers no support for installation, The game is fun, but lacks many of the features in the past titles. Also despite promises that the server problems are now over it can still take several hour to communicate through the servers to your own towns, during the waiting time you can loose several hundred thousand in game dollars that you must pay back to one town, that will never arrive in your other.
