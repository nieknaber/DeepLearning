Terrific DLC. For me, this really completes the background of the Mass Effect universe and leaves a solid question answered.<br /><br />I hate BioWare points, though. It's such a stupid system - just sell the DLC directly with a game code. I probably would have bought *more* DLC if I didn't have to deal with an archaic &#34;points&#34; system. We live in a world with real currencies, we don't need fake ones.
