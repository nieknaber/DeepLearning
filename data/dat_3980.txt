Installed this game on windows 8.1 cant get full screen. I should have let sleeping dogs lye because I went into the games settings options to change screen size.. Now I lost the right side one third of screen and cant change it back or have no access to any game controls other than moving character on screen... I cant even end turn. This game is not really compatable with new windows. I did run a compatability scan to set it to windows xp and still nothing. Waste of time and money... Cant even contact any seller as I get message that its not possible.
