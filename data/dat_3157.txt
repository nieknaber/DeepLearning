I bought this game, Bioshock 2, and GTA4 on sale for 5 dollars each. This is a very respectable deal that competes with Steam's sale prices.  However, Amazon's servers do not compete with Steam's.  Think twice before hitting the pause button on the amazon downloader.  If you pause the download it's likely you will not be able to resume it.  My downloads have restarted a couple of time when closing downloader program even though it should still be running in the background and shows it running on on the system trey.<br /><br />You should also be warned that Arma 2 takes some decent hardware to run.  My quad core i5 760 and overclocked 1GB GTX 460 have a harder time running this than Crysis, or Just Cause 2.
