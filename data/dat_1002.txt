This a great game if you like simulation games, This not like simcity, This game makes you<br />earn your own money to buy more and bigger equipment. You start off with some cash and<br />just enough equipment to get started. I can't stop playing I need more equipment and fields to<br />expand on. They also give some challenges to make more money.<br /><br />It's a little confusing in the beginning with no info on the use of the key board. But figured it out.
