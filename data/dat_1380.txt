This is a horrible game. The leveling system sucks, the perks system sucks, the entire thing is just a tedious grind. Leveling up is boring and unrewarding. The combat is mindless and uninteresting. It's super easy to make money. The whole thing is just bad. So... Why the 5 star review? I've played this game for over 500 hours on Xbox 360 and almost 100 hours on PC. This is a world. An entire universe, with the 9 Divine, the Daedric Princes, Men and Mer, the 9 Provinces in the land of Tamriel, and so much more. The Elder Scrolls Skyrim is an adventure. It fills me with a sense of wonder. I hop into this world and end up reading the wiki for 12 hours. The Daedric Princes are the most interesting in my opinion. With much H.P. Lovecraft inspiration, these... Things have so much depth. When I hop in I feel like a child, wanting to be the hero, and at times the villain, of the story. You don't have many options when it comes to interaction with NPCs, and once you're in a quest it's not all that open world. But Skyrim is forgiven because of how good it's world is. If you've played any of the other Elder Scrolls I don't recommend it at all. But if you have no family, friends, job, and want a bit of an experience. I couldn't recommend this more.
