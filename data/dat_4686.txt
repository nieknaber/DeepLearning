The Xbox One version of this game is about what you would expect: Awesome.<br /><br />Are the graphics noticeably better with breathtaking hi-res textures and more complex polygons and animations? Ha! But that's not what Minecraft is about.<br /><br />There's no real story or campaign or objectives in Minecraft. You simply start out, have a variety of tools and environments to explore/destroy/build upon, and do whatever you want from there.<br /><br />Complexity ranges from ultra simple (TNT go boom lolz!), to as horrendously complex as you want to make it (wiring switches to do all kinds of crazy things, create meta-games, and so forth).<br /><br />There's the standard mode where you have a life bar, more limited resources (which forces you to craft/farm/mine for resources), and enemies. Or creative mode which is more suited for purely creating awesome stuff faster and easier. You can fly, move super fast, have unlimited materials, and so forth. Creative mode will prove to be a much easier way to build that replica Death Star you've been wanting for so long.<br /><br />The console versions of Minecraft are always a little bit behind the PC version in terms of updates, but most won't notice or care except the die-hard Minecrafters. I prefer the console version simply because I prefer my couch to my office chair.<br /><br />One important thing to note is that if you bought the Xbox 360 version previously (digital), you can purchase the Xbox One (digital) version from the Xbox Store for a discounted $4.99, which was totally worth it in my opinion. The Xbox One version also has many new achievements compared with the 360 version (1000 points worth vs 200 points). You may not care about these, but I personally love trying to fully explore the games and unlock all their achievements, so this adds a *lot* of replay value for me. Some of them will take quite some time to attain as they can't be unlocked in Creative mode.<br /><br />But digital discounts aside, I generally prefer disc versions of games. Physical games tend to go on better sales and more frequent sales, they help me expand my fairly expansive physical game library, I don't have to worry as much about disk space, I can lend the game to a friend or resell it, and I have the pleasant feeling of actually owning something tangible. But if these perks don't interest you, the convenience of digital is nice to have to (switch games without swapping discs).<br /><br />It might take awhile of tinkering around with the game before you \\"get it\\", but once you do, it can be a lot of fun.on better sales and more frequent sales, they help me expand my fairly expansive physical game library, I don't have to worry as much about disk space, I can lend the game to a friend or resell it, and I have the pleasant feeling of actually owning something tangible.
