I had to have this title as I have played since I think 90's got it and yea...can't use...ok lame..but it gets better...they have no support to speak of and no servers to use...god how I hate steam based games.<br />well took game back to Wal-Mart and with a huge line of people who were returning the game did the same thing. returned and bought Guild wars...which by the way is awesome and works just fine...NEVER EVER BUY GAME Hooked to that mandatory online end unless you check out who is selling it...EA..never again what a bunch of idiots making a single player awesome game into a online piece of junk.
