I'm a huge dork for Time Management games and this is one of my current favorites. The gameplay is fairly simple but it really takes strategy to go back and get gold on each level. That makes it a great game for different ages.<br /><br />It can be simple or challenging depending on your goals. I only wish there was an endless mode.
