The game is pretty weird. The controls and camera can be awkward. But once you get the hang of it, it's a ton of fun. The game has tons of little easter eggs and an AWESOME SOUNDTRACK! If you were a fan of Katamari Damacy, you should be used to the weird controls and strange art style. Go buy it and help us get to Saturn (You get the Moon, Mars, and Jupiter off the bat XD)!
