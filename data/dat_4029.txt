I failed to notice the \\"E\\" rating, which would have alerted me to the likelihood that the game is intended for young people.  Kids might give the game a higher rating. The game play takes place within a window, not full screen, and the window won't expand.  The characters move from space to space.  If a character encounters a space occupied by an adversary, the scene changes to a \\"battle board\\".  The battles are turn based, and take place in a limited area reminiscent of a Stratego board and involve strategic moves using troop icons.  The story line is cut from the fabric of fantasy role playing games.
