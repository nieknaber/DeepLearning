The added trade routes are smart and I feel it encourages many civilizations to try to get along with each other better rather than warmongering quite so much. The other changes are mostly more related to later in the game, but they are smart and add to the game.  Both culture victories and world leader victories are much more robust.<br /><br />My only gripe (but this may also apply to the base game) is that gold leads too clearly to victory through purchasing city-state alliances.  So far that is the way I have won almost all of my games, by simply buying off enough city states to get world leader.
