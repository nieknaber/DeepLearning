This game is perfect to practice patience,but talking in a good way. Have you seen some Tibetan monks drawing on sand to bring the inner peace?,well ,this game has most of it but with machines.<br /><br />  The graphics are really cool and all the farmer environment is really nice captured with nice views.Maybe there is not much to say about this game,only that is basically more for adults than young guys because it hasn't the attractive of others actions games. Remember,this is a simulator,but you don't have to kill anyone,just to give you an idea of a Farmer's life.<br /><br />  It is a nice game indeed!
