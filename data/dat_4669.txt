Cannot for the life of me get this game to work.  Constantly getting errors saying that I must have Sims 3 installed first, which I do.  Have been in contact with Steam and EA Games but neither have been much help.  I just want a refund but of course I can't get that because it is DLC....ugh....so frustrated.
