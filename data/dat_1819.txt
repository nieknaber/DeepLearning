It's just like an expansion pack. Glad I got it for $30. Not worth anything above that. They reorganized a lot of the UI. Most of the gameplay is the same just with different names. They did introduce a few new aspects including missions, victories, and Affinities. Affinities are by far the most interesting thing. You can upgrade your troops to one of the three affinity groups. They earn benefits from the group as well. A recent update also fixed a lot of issues with that game. If you're a Civilization fan, this is just more of that same fun, but it's not really anything new.
