I just love these Big Cit Adventure games and have purchased four from Amazon.  (You all need to offer more.)  The Paris edition is beautiful and almost makes me feel as though I'm actually there.  I have seven in all and they all work perfectly on my computer, which runs Vista.  However, the two I have downloaded from Amazon tend to take over my desktop and I usually need to restart the computer to access my other programs.  A nuisance.
