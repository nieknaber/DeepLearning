I would LOVE to review this game but I never got it to play. I downloaded and when it came time to get the game up and running it had a file missing. SO I tried to uninstall it, so I could reinstall....sounds easy right? But I got another evil error message that said I had to uninstall in 64 bit windows but it wouldn't do it. Neither Amazon, nor the Software company, that they referred me too has been helpful in rectifying this problem. As a matter of fact I haven't even heard from the software company. So, I am not happy at ALL with my experience in this matter and have no problem giving a negative review in the customer service area here!
