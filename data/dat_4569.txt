Giana Sisters is probably a game that you would least expect to get a new entry to. I wouldn't have even expected it to get a reboot with the same name as the first. But it happened, and it has a subtitle. The graphics are great, and the controls even moreso. The mechanic fits with the series and doesn't feel gimmicky when you use it. I recommend this game.
