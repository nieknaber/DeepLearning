It is like a fat man first shooter.  I was hoping it would be tanks that could shoot while moving.  So that more skill is involved in shooting.  Lining up your shot based on your speed and your targets and hope they keep the same heading.  The fighting in my opinion is very lame.  Hell you can even snipe as a tank.  YOUR IN A TANK!!!!.  When did tanks become a stealthy firing war machine.  Just not impress with the game play.  Graphics were decent.  Maybe this is good for those who cant handle most first person shooters.  You could sub the tanks for really fat men with a hand gun and it would make a more interesting game.
