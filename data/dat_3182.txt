I thought Dragon Age 1 was pretty fun but it wasn't good enough to motivate me to beat it.<br /><br />I couldn't stop playing Dragon Age II until it was done.  That says a lot these days for me.<br /><br />Here are my pros:<br /><br />The combat and the talent trees are vastly improved over Dragon Age I.<br />The dialog and acting is top notch<br />The storyline is pretty good with some excellently realized characters (Fenris is awesome).<br /><br />The main con:<br /><br />Recycled areas and mobs.<br /><br />Conclusion:<br /><br />Yeah so they obviously rushed this out the door.  The fact of the matter is that before kicking it out the door they fixed almost all the problems I had with the first one.  I'll trade some repetitiveness in environments and mobs for gameplay that is ten times better than the first one.<br /><br />BUY IT!
