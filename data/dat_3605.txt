FTL is a gem of a game, where you command a spaceship facing difficult odds in making it across the galaxy and defeating your foes.<br /><br />Your ship starts out as little more than a lightly armed freighter, but as you progress you recruit a crew and start adding upgrades. This makes for a unique playthrough each time, as during one session you might become a cloaked raider that strikes from the shadows, or a tech heavy ship that sends drones to fight for you, or just a classic battlecruiser that wins by slugging it out.<br /><br />The crews of your ship are fun to build, as there is a diverse cast that begins with generic humans, but lets you gain rockmen who excel at fighting fires, mantis men that can chop through intruders, and even space slugs who can detect where enemies lurk. Your crew gains experience so you get quite attached, and it is a tragedy to lose a veteran to an uncontrolled hull breach.<br /><br />This is a difficult game, as you cannot save your progress when playing, but I found that makes the game more tense and provides higher stakes. An example of this is when you encounter an abandoned space station with the option to send your crew to search. If you could save, this would be without risk as you could simply reload if the outcome was undesirable. But without that crutch, you must carefully consider if sending your crew to salvage is worth the scrap metal, or if the odds of a space spider attack are too great.<br /><br />This has been one of my favorite indie games in recent years, and is highly recommended to anyone seeking a great space experience!
