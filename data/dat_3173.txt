This is a beautifully crafted MMO that has learned from past MMOs and fixes most of what is wrong/stale/old with MMOs. The games quests are wonderfully inventive and mostly avoid traditional MMO quest cliches. Not having character classes frees you up to build your character however you want. You can have several totally different builds and switch between them as much as you like. The game also doesn't have character levels. While this frees you up a bit more to explore the content you want, it does make it harder to get a feel for just how strong your character is (most players use the quality level of their gear as their de facto level).<br /><br />SETTING<br />One of the best things about The Secret World is how well it exhudes atmosphere. It has a dark, otherworldly feel but still has some great humor, thanks mostly to some very funny cut scenes with some great voice acting.<br /><br />QUESTS<br />The Secret World's quests require brain power not button spamming or 'kill X number of monsters' body counting. Quests are no longer a chore but something that are actually fun to complete. My last quest took me through a haunted, abandoned amusment park and I actually got to ride (from a first person view) on a haunted roller coaster! I can't say that I've ever done anything even remotely similar to that in another game.<br /><br />COMBAT<br />I have found the combat to be quite a bit more fun then traditional MMO button spamming. While somewhat frustrating initially, I have long since grown to really like the added strategies it allows. In most MMOs, combat is fairly static with little regard needed for where your character is positioned. The Secret World is a lot more dynamic, requiring you to also mind where you are standing in combat and to dodge out of the way when necessary (the dodge is a nice looking forward/sideways/backwards roll).<br /><br />GRAPHICS<br />The graphics are all first-rate. I was watching a The Secret World promotional video on YouTube recently and one of the comments was someone complaining about how he wanted to see actual gameplay footage and not just cutscene footage. It looked so good that he didn't even realize he was watching gameplay footage (with the GUI interface turned off).<br /><br />OTHER PLAYERS<br />The game was not a commercial sucess when it launched but it continues to benifit from great word of mouth and substantial content updates. Funcom has said they will try to release one new update every month, though in reality it seems to average every 5 - 6 weeks. TSW has a smaller but loyal fan base, though since they stopped requiring a subscription to play, there has been a big increase in the number of people playing. Most players are friendly and helpful and the game itself has a rather mature player base.<br /><br />CONCLUSION<br />Overall, I've been very impressed with this game. It manages to deliver an immersive, original MMO experience without a lot of baggage traditional MMOs come with, like tedious grinding or a rigid class structures. Funcom, the company that makes it, has a long history of supporting its games (its first MMO, Anarchy-Online, launched in 2001 and is still going today). There are a few bugs and other issues in the game, but I think that is mostly due to Funcom always being a bit more ambitious than they have the resources for. The Secret World is quite fun and definitely worth trying.
