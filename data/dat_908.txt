If you love finding hidden objects, this game is for you!  The graphics are stunning and the mini games are fun as well.  If you like to challenge yourself, play along with the timer and enjoy the game.  Initially, you have all of the time you need and then some,but as the game progresses, it gets a little harder but so much more fun!  The kids and myself had a blast trying to outscore each other and before I knew it, we were hooked!  Two thumbs up here, this game is so much fun!
