Okay, after owning every expansion since the Sims 3's release, I can easily say that Seasons is my favorite. It makes the game so much more realistic! The download worked perfectly for me. As long as you have a decent computer and don't mind using Origin, getting the expansion for 50% off normal price is a steal. Well, Snowflake Day should be coming to my sims' town soon. Better get the holiday decor out!
