I oredered the online game code and found it to be very convenient. I strongly dislike putting my card information on the Xbox because of there auto-renewal features they automatically sign you up for and because of the playstation network credit card debacle. This is easy and you get the code instantly. It also works great for giving a gift. I hope amazon keeps doing this as I will continue to use this feature down the road.
