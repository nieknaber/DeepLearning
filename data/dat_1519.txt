Like all Lego games I have played this one is very fun, the voice acting and humor throughout is great. However no matter what resolution I play this game at it will not go full screen, there is a black bar on the top and bottom of the screen which makes it difficult to see. I have not had this problem with any other Lego games in the past.<br /><br />EDIT: Changing aspect ratio to \\"From screen res\\" fixed the black bars for me.
