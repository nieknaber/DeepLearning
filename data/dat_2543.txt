Okay, I am busting out into a new genre of reviews so don't be too brutal.  I intend to review many more hidden object games but this is the first game that got me to do so.  I really loved this game!  It is very cartoony compared to many other HO games but I found it to be colorful and quite fun.  I enjoyed how to you put things together in the HO scenes instead of just finding them and clicking.  I thought the characters were pretty sexy and I liked the whole vampire thing (and no, I have never seen a Twilight movie).  I liked the map and the leaves and really just thought this was a good game for a teenager or an adult (girl or boy!)
