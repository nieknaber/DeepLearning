Had it for a month, it has single handedly gotten me back into console gaming. The free games make this feel like you are ripping sony off. Dragons Dogma was fantastic, and I'm playing through Xcom now, then Grid 2, then Brothers, then DMC, Then Bioshock Infinite, then Uncharted 3, and by then even more games will be available.<br /><br />It is crazy good value.
