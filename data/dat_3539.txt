First the good:<br />Good graphics<br />Sniping is fun.  You can wound an enemy in order to draw out their friends while he writhes on the ground in pain.<br />Your in-game &#34;buddies&#34; actually kill enemies.  A few times, I showed up to &#34;rescue&#34; a buddy and all the bad guys were dead already.<br />You get to drive different types of cars and boats.<br /><br />Now the ugly:<br />There are basically three different types of missions in this game:<br />1.  Assassinate somebody.<br />2.  Blow up something.<br />3.  Get an item which is likely located in the middle of an enemy base.<br /><br />Do any of the above missions many times. It gets old fast.  Plus, you have to run all over the map to get to each mission, which means that you can either wipe out multiple guard posts, or try to sneak by them.  Too bad enemies can spot you in the dead of night in the wild jungle from 100 feet away about 80% of the time.  I eventually just started driving at full speed through most guard checkpoints.  Then I would stop my car (which almost always was badly damaged by enemy gun fire), kill anybody following me, and then take their car.<br /><br />A Mac-10 kills faster than a PKM.  Who decided on the weapon damage in this game?<br />Weapons degrade quickly, which pretty much forces you to buy the &#34;Reliability Upgrade&#34; for each weapon you use.<br />Silenced weapons are pretty useless, since the enemy homes in on you instantly.<br /><br />The plot involves two factions fighting for power in some nameless African nation.  Honestly, I really don't know what really happened because the paper-thin plot was just an excuse to kill people, blow things up, or retrieve items.  I'd say that Tetris has a more involving story.  It feels like a lot of work went into this game, only for it to be rushed out the door 6 months before it was completed.<br /><br />I have a two-speaker audio setup.  Although music and weapons fire came through loud and clear, I had trouble hearing voices.  A web search revealed that this game uses 5.1 surround sound, and voices come through the middle speaker...which I don't have.  There is no way to change the in-game settings.  Thankfully, subtitles appear so you don't have to hear the voices, but this is just part of why it feels like this game was rushed out the door before being finished.<br /><br />I cannot recommend this game.
