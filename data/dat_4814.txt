Ok so I've been playing this game for 2 months, spend almost 200 hours on it, have 2 lvl 50's and I have to say there are many things that I do like about the game but sadly after encountering many many more bugs than I can count in game, the negatives outweighs the positives for me.<br /><br />Some examples of the bug:<br />- New area &#34;Blighthaven&#34; that was released on early July, have about 80% of the quests text in there showing as blank.<br />- Daily quest &#34;Queen for a day&#34;, the npc becomes bugged every other day.<br />- Items randomly disappear from bag, on forum the dev said the item will reappear within a week, some ppl reported their items have yet to reappear after a month.<br />- Lost few platinum from buying bank slots, supposed to cost 1p, took twice the amount of that.<br />- Blue quality items turns into white quality items.<br />- Some skills don't display telegraphs.<br />- Some skills randomly stopped working until relog.<br /><br />These are some of the bugs that I've encountered in this game, combine it with basically non-existent customer support, sadly drove me away from this game. Their idea of customer support is copy and paste or automatic response, and if you lost something due to a bug, they will not reimburse you for that. This game has a lot of potentials, sadly it seems that for Carbine, it is more important to keep making new things or changing stuffs, instead of actually fixing the bugs.<br /><br />Another thing for ppl who likes to role play, the dye system in this game is horrible, even after you have the dye that you want, you still have to pay huge amount of gold to dye your armor, I've seen it cost as high as 18p to dye a set of armor which is worth 3 CREDD or 3 months of game time in my server basically.<br /><br />I'm not expecting a bug free game especially ones that is released just 2 months ago but when so many game breaking bugs have yet to be fixed and they keep making new stuffs which when released, some are also broken too, it becomes unacceptable to me. That said, I'm planning to check back on the game a few months from now and hopefully they will fix most stuffs by then and when they do, I'm going to update my review but for now, it has been a major disappointment for me.
