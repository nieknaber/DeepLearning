the game is beautiful it plays well the hand placement of the game is a bit hard to get use to but not unplayble i have a half a gig graphics card and it runs with a little bit of chop witch tends to be anoying and thats on low settings but anyone looking for a awesome twist to alice in wonderland i would not pass this up.
