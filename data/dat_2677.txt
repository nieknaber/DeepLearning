I bought this during Amazon's Year-End Sale and I figured for the price (it was only $1) I'd give it a try. It's a good game but it's a little limited. I'm wondering if this isn't more of an expansion pack that can be played by itself. Either way the game has it's perks.<br /><br />Graphics-The graphics look a little dated, but not as bad as you might think. The water looks great though. And the ships were pretty cool looking.<br /><br />Game Play -Basically the game is played by controlling your flagships. You can steer them, allow them to fire and control their<br />speed. While I like this concept, It would've been nice to be able to control each individual ship as well.<br /><br />U.I.-The interface is pretty basic with the only thing that may be confusing is the compass or, more likely, the wind indicator. I'm not really sure what it is.<br /><br />Overall the game is fun and I really like it, but it's pretty much one of those &#34;jump in and start playing&#34;  games as there wasn't a tutorial. For the price, even if it turns out to be an expansion pack, it's still worth a dollar for anyone looking for some 1880's Ironclad battles.
