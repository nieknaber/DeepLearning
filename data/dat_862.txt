This game is obviously a PC port of what was intended to be a console game. After buying it, I found that unlike virtually every other PC game in existence, the installer, which works through steam, will NOT allow you to choose what folder to install to, the upshot being that if, like me, you have a full C-drive and want to install new games to another, you are out of luck. Such a basic feature, the absence of which make the game a rip-off at least for me. You have been warned.
