Bought this card one month ago.<br />Entered the code, good to go.<br />It expired tonight after _one month_.<br />The card i purchased was 12 months......<br />Read the other reviews on this before making a purchase, it seems this is a common problem.<br />Now i guess i need to get on the horn with MS to get this straightened out.....Ohter reviews indicated this might take an hour or longer!!!!!<br />BUYER BEWARE!
