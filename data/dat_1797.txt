I picked this game up on the Mac App store for eight dollars on a Black Friday deal.  It's hard to find good games that run within the mac os (and not via bootcamp) so I've wanted to try this one since picking up my MBP a little over three years ago.<br /><br />How It Runs:<br />I am running 10.6.8 Snow Leopard on my \\"Late 2008\\" 13\\" macbook pro.  It has the Nvidia Geforce 8600M, 4 GB of ram and a 2.53 Intel Core 2 Duo processor.  The game ran smoothly with the standard graphic settings and I had no crashes.<br /><br />Single Player:<br />I think this is my first \\"first person shooter\\" game since Rainbow Six: Rouge Spear.  Yup that's right, a game which came out in 1999 and was played on good old Windows 98.  I am just so-so when it comes to shooters (both in skill and interest), but I did enjoy the game once I got the hang of it.  The story is just good enough to keep you interested in continuing through it and the game is good about \\"guiding\\" you through (when to pick up guns and where to go, etc).  The voice acting is terrific and the soundtrack is good as well.  I also liked the facts on how much different military equipment costs as well as the quotes that were on the load screens.<br /><br />My only complaint is that it just seemed a bit short.  After the ending scene, I kind of just sat there and thought \\"that's it?\\"  If you are only getting it for the story (which probably isn't the case for most people), it might not be worth thirty dollars as it isn't quite as engrossing as other games out there.  All in all, I felt it was worth the money I had paid.<br /><br />After you finish the game you can replay it in a different difficulty or play missions from the game and try and earn higher points (I have yet to do this as I just finished the game).  I was kind of hoping it would have mini-games similar to Rouge Spear (i.e. play a map where it is you against 30 \\"bad guys\\")<br /><br />Multiplayer:<br />I haven't tried this yet and I am not sure I will.  I know mostpeople who get into COD games are all about the multiplayer, but I guess I am more of a mission guy.  Plus I am not very good so I'm sure I would get destroyed.
