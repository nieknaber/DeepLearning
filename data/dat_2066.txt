Has some issues with PC controls as far as targeting... and I feel like it's maybe a bit too much of a sandbox so some of the narrative gets lost.  That said, good bang for your buck as theirs tons of gameplay.  Crafting system is good, fun and meaningful.  Skill tress would be one dimensional (each class has the same set) except that once you clear 10 you get specializations so that's pretty awesome too.  Areas are vast and fun to explore, quests are plentiful, combat/skill tree combos are also good.  Overall a nearly perfect game.
