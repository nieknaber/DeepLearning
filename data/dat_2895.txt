This is one of those \\"two sides to every coin\\" type bundles.<br /><br />First off, Fable: The Lost Chapters; great game for its time.  You ask anyone who has played it during the Xbox era and I can guarantee that they will say it was an awesome experience.  I could get into detail about how everything about the game mechanics were well done, but then I would be stuck at my computer all day remembering all the bits and bobs that made Fable 1 great.  What I can tell you is: if you're looking for a game that provides an enthralling story and fair visual graphics for our current time, you can't go wrong with Fable.<br /><br />That leaves the other side of the coin, Fable 3.  I've played through this game twice now; once on the xbox 360 and once on the pc.  And I can tell you with absolute clarity that this game is horrible.  The mechanics are riddled with bugs, the user-friendly design has all but obscured any form of leveling or information pertaining to your skills, the achievement system and weapon development is specialized around multiplayer, weapon skins are very limited, there are 6 spells and 15 combinations of spells (1 of which doesn't actually do anything).  AoE spell attacks have a limit to how many enemies are affected which is noticeable as the pc version has nearly twice as many enemies on screen for you to handle, the quest locator system (bread-crumb trail) can often disable itself or lead players on wild goose chases, and the mini-maps are horrendously inaccurate.  Other than that and many other problems or critiques that I find are missing compared to its predecessors, the world design is very beautiful and story is interesting enough to push the player forward.
