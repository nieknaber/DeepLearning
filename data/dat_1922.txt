Briefly, the best review I can give would be just take my word for it and try this hidden objects game bundle. I thoroughly enjoyed these three games and will continue to play them again. The only thing I wanted to make sure before I  purchased this product was to make sure that the game download was of a nice size and worth my time and space on my PC. I don't believe in purchasing a download that is small and short. I think it should last a longtime, which will give me more pleasurable hours of fun.
