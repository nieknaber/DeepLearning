Have purchased many games through Amazon over the past two years, but Hidden object bundle 10in1 is by far the worst I have ever received.  I have been very happy with the other games I have purchased and have replayed them many times.  It won't prevent me from ordering more in the future, but I've noticed there isn't as much to choose from anymore.<br /><br />J.P.
