It turned out to be payment for an item on a bogus site. So therefore a waste of money. I have decided that playstation money should only be for playstation items. it would perhaps help others to post on your site that INVIES is a fradulent  site and no real business.<br />I would urge everyone to only use payments sites like paypal or credit card gift cards as there is recourse if fraud involved.
