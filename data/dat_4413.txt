Haven't even played it yet but I already hate it.  It was promoted as being compatible with Windows 8, but like all the games I had with Windows Vista, when I moved them to my new PC, it came up in a screen so small (about 4x6 inches) that it was impossible to read, not to mention play.  You can switch it to the window mode, but it's no better.  I can't believe the manufacturer would be so dishonest about this.  If there is a work around it should be published with the game.  No more DVG Interium games for me.
