If you have a computer from the star ship Enterprise it may work. It practically destroyed my normal computer. My computer guy smiled and shook his head. He has been my computer guy since he was 3 I think. Runs a very excellent business and the whole city goes to him that I know of. If you want this buy a computer JUST FOR IT or do something else...like bowling. Ugh.
