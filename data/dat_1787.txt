An amazing game with a great story and a superb ending.<br /><br />They recycle assets.  For example, all dungeons look the same with different routes blocked off or open but otherwise the same in texture and layout.  They have you return to the same areas numerous times.<br /><br />If you can get over that, it is a well designed game with great voice acting and a great story.  It's quite a bit different from DA:0 and doesn't quite live up to the standard that was set by that game but it is fun nonetheless.<br /><br />The combat is fun and in a game which is 60% combat that's pretty important.  The story is well written which accounts for the other 40% of an RPG.  Graphics and UI could use some work but it isn't so bad as to recommend avoiding the game.<br /><br />I loved it.
