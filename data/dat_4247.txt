So this was a lovely experience.  I downloaded this game which clearly states (Mac Download) and after trouble shooting and finally calling EA games, they were able (after hours of trying to fix this) determine that Amazon is selling this as a Mac Download, and it is not compatible with Mac.  So now, I am trying to get a hold of customer service through Amazon to refund my money and hopefully they will take this off their site.
