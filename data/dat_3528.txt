Risen is an entertaining and challenging  game.  I am still looking for stuff before entering the biggest city.  The instructions encourage you to stay away from the most difficult &#34;beasts&#34; and get back later.  That's great advice because difficult ones show up from early in the story.<br /><br />Fun to play game...
