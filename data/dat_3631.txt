So here is the thing. I bought a physical card a while ago. Tucked it away since I still had time on my GOLD account.  Account eventually expired and I pull out this card.  I scratch off the silver to redeem it.  It tells me it has been redeemed.  So I get with Microsoft to find out what happened and they said it was redeemed on another account.  Now 2 possibilities- either someone stole the code from Microsoft and penetrated their system.  Or they inadvertently put the same code on two cards.  Or sold one digitally and the other physically.  None of these outcomes is good.
