I picked up this game actually because it was on sale and cheap. I never expected to get a game this good. Pretty good action- your character fighting,and fighting while riding his mount swingin' his sword or shooting arrows, and not bad graphics, ya just gotta get used to controls. Once ya get that down, you'll have a great deal of fun...My advice is **buy it** very cheap price, for all your getting, and I'll get credit for giving good advice.
