The previous reviewers who reported problems with controls are partially correct. If you want the game to recognize a gamepad or whatever, you have to use it exclusively instead of the keyboard from the very start. Skip the intro and navigate the menus to start the game all with a controller and it will work just fine in-game. I ran into the same issue and had to do a little Googling to figure that out.<br /><br />Otherwise, there's nothing wrong with this game at all. Good graphics, tight controls, interesting missions, and a highly detailed city to drive through. You don't just have streets and buildings, there are parking garages, construction sites, train tracks, and all kinds of obstacles, ramps, and areas you can drive around in. In fact, you're often rewarded for going off-road and ducking down alleys, busting through barriers and fences, and being creative with your routes.<br /><br />The game reminds me a bit of the Driver series, maybe a bit of Need for Speed Undercover, and some Ridge Racer Unbounded. It's more about car chases than straight up racing though. Sometimes you're doing the chasing, sometimes you're being chased, sometimes both. There are also fun gadgets and tricks you can use, like a remote controlled bomb you can launch and drive under opponents to blow them up.<br /><br />Overall it's a fun game! Just remember about how to get it to make your controller the primary input while driving and you'll have a great time with it.
