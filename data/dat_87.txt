I don't understand why there is so much hate for this game. My almost five old daughter absolutely loves it on her little Atom powered netbook.<br /><br />The graphics (and sound) are cute, and the gameplay is easy enough to grasp. Honestly for adults there is probably nothing here, but children will be enthralled by this overly simplistic strategy title. There are things to build, items to gather, and monsters to fight. Anything that gets a thumbs up from my daughter, also gets a thumbs up from me.<br />Now while I don't think it's worth the full $6.99 asking price, it's certainly a good enough deal for free (or even $.99 cents).<br /><br />I don't know how long the SQRLUVIO will work, so hopefully you manage to snag King's Legacy as a free download. Otherwise hold off until it gets to the $.99 price point.<br /><br />Side note: There are a few reviews that say you can't proceed past level three, that is false as my girl is already on the fourth level. Really, if a five year old can figure it out - an adult gamer should as well.
