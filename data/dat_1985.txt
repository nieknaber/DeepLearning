Played Afterlight a while after it was originally released.<br /><br />It's a great game, true to the original XCOM series.<br /><br />The Planet scape is great & always evolving with the terraforming of Mars.<br /><br />The fight levels are great & ERIE, just like they should be. I particularly liked the research & the tools you get to use.<br /><br />I rated it 5/5 because it feels like an original XCOM game, it is crazy fun, the interface is great (you play the game, not micro manage the interface), the story is nice and the graphics were good too.<br /><br />At the discounted price it's being sold now, it's definately worth buying for any XCOM fan.
