I purchased this since I was a big fan of Total War Rome.<br /><br />My thoughts after about 20 hours of play are the following:<br /><br />-  The computer will cheat<br />-  Good luck winning any Normal or higher mode games against the computer<br />-  This is a fun game to kill a few hours with.<br />- The ability to manually control your soldiers is entertaining.. its total war after all.. however the outcome will likely be the same computer or manual control.<br /><br />I gave the game 3 stars since it was entertaining and worth the money I paid.
