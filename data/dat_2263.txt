Better than average game. Fun to play, and with a lot more story than the usual Wolfenstein game. I had to get this since I was designing graphics cards when Castle Wolfenstein came out and actually had to play that more than a few times as part of our card driver debug and this was a nice trip down memory lane (make sure you get the mini-game of the original in this one to see how far things have come). It's nice to see the franchise coming back. Overall, I'd give this 4.4 stars if they let me.
