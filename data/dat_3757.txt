This addicting game has some serious flaws in it's coding. At level 58, the three machines I put this game on either froze up, locked down the driver for the video or incompletely loaded the game (no top bar across the screen to show any information). Do not buy this game from anyone. I got mine from some place other than Amazon for $3 and would have been seriously perturbed if I had paid more. Fortunately for me I can get a refund or replacement.<br />If I could give this NO stars I would, even though I really like Alawar games as a whole. They really messed up this one.
