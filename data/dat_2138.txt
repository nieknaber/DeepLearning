I was first introduced to COD through this game in the zombies mode. I then got black ops + black ops 2, and all the DLC for zombies. I've always wondered why they didn't put much real variety into their game, and then I found the modding zombie community. Once I saw this, I proceded to buy this game and find maps to play on it. This game is too good for me, 5/5
