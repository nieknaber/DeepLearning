System requirements as listed by Amazon.com for COH2 lists XP as a supported OS. One has to run COH2 through Steam. My message from Steam technical customer support as follows;<br /><br />\\"Hello,<br /><br />A staff member has replied to your question:<br /><br />Hello,<br /><br />Thank you for contacting Steam Support.<br /><br />I am sorry but your computer does not meet the minimum system requirements in order to play this title. Company of Heroes 2 is not supported on Windows XP<br /><br />System requirements are indicated at the bottom of the Steam Store page for the title, and on the package for retail copies.<br /><br />Please ensure your computer meets the minimum system requirements prior to completing your purchase.\\"<br /><br />I DID READ SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS and they are listed below.<br /><br />  Minimum Specifications:<br />OS: Win 7, Vista and XP<br />Processor: 2Ghz Intel Core2 Duo or Equivalent<br />RAM: 2 GB<br />Hard Drive: Unknown<br />Video Card: 256MB Direct3D 10 capable video card (GeForce 8800 or RadeonHD 2900)<br />Additional Info: Unknown<br /><br />Amazon clearly lists XP as a supported OS for this game.

Pretty soon you will sit in the clueless pile like EA has done with Command and Conquer franchise.<br /><br />Now. does anyone know how to return a downloaded game on Amazon that will not play?<br /><br />signed<br />old school
