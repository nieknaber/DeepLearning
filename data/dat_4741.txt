I'll be entirely honest, I haven't even played all the included games yet (RA2, I'm getting there).  Barring any unforeseen issues with that title or it's expansion, this overall is not a bad package at all.  C&C4 was a flop and everyone knows it, and all the other games already have individual reviews, so I'll just stick to the product as a whole.  Altogether, I'm glad I purchased it now, but it was a pain to get everything to work.  First off, Origin.  That part flat out blows.  Not because I hate Origin, I actually don't mind it, but because some titles (RA3 I'm positive) don't work if installed on drives other than C.  Why?  Because of the Origin launchers included.  So go ahead and do yourself a favor and pick up some cracked .exe's if you want to mod or do anything of that nature.  However, after a bit of work, mods and everything do indeed work, so I am ultimately happy to have every released C&C game to date at my disposal, anywhere I go.<br /><br />Pros:<br />-I like pretty much all the games outside of C&C4, so having them all in the cloud is great<br />-If you're in North America, you also get some great music<br />-The price is pretty good, even though the originals can be found for free, 20 bucks for C&C3 and RA3, the two more modern titles worth playing, is not bad at all<br /><br />Cons:<br />-Eats up a lot of C drive space for a guy like me with a SSD<br />-Mods are finicky, you'll want cracked .exe files to launch the games<br />-C&C4...need I say more?<br />-No more beta access, new C&C games are scrapped...<br />-Origin can be finicky, and DRM is a huge minus to many gamers<br /><br />If you don't have/haven't played any C&C titles, but call yourself an RTS gamer, you're wrong.  The original C&C helped create a whole genre of PC games, and if you want a legitimate way to get your hands on PC gaming history, this package is the way to go.  Just be prepared to troubleshoot a bit.
