I admit, I am very, very tired of the latest \\"Call of Battlefield\\" military-themed FPS games out there. They are all indistinguishable from one another - all involve saving the world, all involve similar tactics, and 10 minutes into such a game, you have a firm, \\"been there, done that\\" vibe. I played and greatly enjoyed Bioshock 1 and 2, because they were set in a very unique and atmospheric setting, and had a great story-line as well.<br /><br />By the time of this review, this game as long been out and reviewed to death. Still, I wanted to throw in my two cents because I have now played through the entire game and feel it deserves every bit of critical praise heaped upon it.<br /><br />You play as Booker Dewitt, an ex-Pinkerton sent to a city in the clouds to rescue a girl. It is set in the early 1900's. You have plasmids (like in Bioshock) but they are called Vigors here. The story is quite good, the voice-acting is outstanding, and the action is fresh, with plenty of action. About half way through it started to feel a bit repetitive, as most shooters do, but once I understood that I needed to be upgrade my Vigors, I started using them more creatively and the combat finally clicked for me.<br /><br />The graphics and colors in this world are stunning. It was amazing how much detail and thought went into even the smallest details, details you would miss unless you were looking carefully. The game ended, and I found myself searching the internet to see if others shared my interpretation of it. The overall story is quite thought provoking - something I expect from a book or good movie, not a game. Play it yourself and see. I don't want to risk spoiling anything, but if you love a good story in an FPS (think Half-life 2, or the original Deus-ex) this game is worth a look. At first blush it may seem more of the same, but it isn't. This is a modern day masterpiece - an overused phrase but once that applies here.
