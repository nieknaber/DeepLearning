I was a huge fan of the Pharoah/Cleopatra game.  I enjoy these types of building/managing games far more than other types of video games.  This one is great for people who liked Pharoah, and is even better since you can turn objects at angles, and individual buildings do not all require road access.  You can make paths and roads marking out areas and mapping your city, then realistically place your buildings and objects where you want them and people will walk to them. With the older games, you were kind of stuck just building huge squares.  You also don't have to worry about placing your houses so close to where your people will work.  In some of the other city builders I've played, you have to put your neighborhoods just about next door to all your employment, or the buildings will stand empty because people won't walk a little ways to go to work.  In this game, people will walk vast distances and even hop in little boats and cross rivers to go to work.  Much more realistic.  Something else new here is that your city-building is in no way dependent on money--because there is no money in the game. Food is the only currency and all your construction is done using materials taken, or made from, the land on the map.  Graphics are nice--no pixelation.  More decorating objects would be better, but you can still make an impressive-looking city. More challenges or free-form/open play scenarios would also have been a bonus--a map editor for unlimited custom play like in Pharoah or Caesar would have been great. Still, a very enjoyable game for those who like to think and build as oppose to run, jump, and shoot.  Already recommended it to the other people I know who like the Pharoah/Ceasar games.
