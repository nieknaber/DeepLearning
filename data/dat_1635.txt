I started playing Flyff when I was 14 years old. Recently, Amazon e-mailed me about their Starter Kit in the game, so I decided to play it again with a new character (and now I'm 20). It was fun for a few hours, but like all MMOs, it gets old quickly.<br /><br />I know that some people love these sort of games so I won't mark it low, but MMOs have just never been my style except for a select few that have managed to hook me, such as Phantasy Star Online, Endless Online (which I got bored of eventually), and Shin Megami Tensei (which is similar to Phantasy Star and a regular console-based game that I think it's what keeps me going).<br /><br />Pros about Flyff is it's a massive game with nice graphics that's actually free. I suggest that you try it before you play it! If you like MMOs, I'm sure that you'll like Flyff.
