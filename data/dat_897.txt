Pro:<br />1. It is a good test of how you use a squad of varying abilities.<br />2. The graphics are good.<br />3. Good turn based game.<br /><br />Con:<br />1. The percentages to hit are misleading.  It has told me I have a 100% chance to hit, while standing next to a guy, and it completely misses the shot.  Even on Veteran characters.  This can leave you in a vulnerable position and can turn the tide of the whole mission.<br />2. What the your solders can carry does not make a lot of sense either.  Small items take up the same space as large items do in your limited areas you can carry things in.<br /><br />Bottom line:<br />I have enjoyed this game a lot even with the frustratingly incorrect to-hit information.  It is challenging and when you make a mistake it can have brutal consequences.  When you lose you favorite guys that you have been building for many missions it is like losing an old friend.  If you like these types of games then get it.  The price is right now.
