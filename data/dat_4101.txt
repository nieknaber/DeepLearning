That pretty much sums up my experience.  There are lots of things to like about the new SimCity.  I think by the end of the year, we'll be looking at a really fine game.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the servers we are REQUIRED to connect to in order to play what is supposed to be a SINGLE-PLAYER GAME have had about 40% uptime.<br /><br />I think the notion of regions and cooperative play with other players is groundbreaking.  Properly executed, this could have been a major evolutionary--no, REVOLUTIONARY--new iteration of the SimCity franchise.  As things stand now, it's a monumental foul-up.<br /><br />I'm not prepared to go so far as to say I'll never get an EA game again, but you can bet your bottom dollar I won't be PRE-ordering an EA title ever again.  That train has now officially left the station.  I'll treat EA products like Microsoft operating systems: I'll wait until at least SP1, if not SP2, before I take the plunge and buy.<br /><br />As for EA nickle-and-diming us to death with DLC, that remains to be seen.  But I'll tell you something: I think they OWE us at least $20 in free DLC as a simple customer relations move once they get things stabilized.  I'm not going to jump on the \\"EA SUXXOR!!\\" bandwagon, but in all fairness, they've got some tall apologizing to do for this debacle.<br /><br />And let us build bigger cities already.  So far the city size constraint hasn't seriously impeded me (if for no other reason than I haven't been able to play the game long enough to actually BUILD OUT to the city limits).  But it will.  I think EA could reap considerable goodwill by doing that ASAP.
