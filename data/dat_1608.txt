Great RPG. If you like hardcore RPGS then you will love this game. Great gameplay, great graphics(can be made better through mods though) And a unique and fun online. Strongly reccomend you play with a game pad, and if you have a PS3, get it on ps3 as the online community is stronger but the game is still solid on this.
