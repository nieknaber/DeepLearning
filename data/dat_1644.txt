I bought this game full price only to be met by a demand to download the dlc so i can actually find servers to play on. Dont buy this game without the dlc. If i were to buy the season pass at this point I would have wasted 100$ on this minor update to battlefield 3. If you have b3 and the dlc's dont bother with this.
