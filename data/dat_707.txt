I purchased this off amazon. I love amazon when it comes to digital downloads of games because I can't install and uninstall them as much as possible and it will always work. But...this games was only sold off amazon, not downloaded from them. I had to go to an outside source, EA/Origin. Well lets just say the directions are confusing and after getting it installed it would not allow me to play my games. It went to the game launcher and when I would click play it would go to the next screen and then close the screen. Never would it launch the game. I decided to uninstall the game period. It was not worth the money. Amazon made a huge mistake having outside downloading sources. DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY!
