Titanfall is definitely a new twist on the FPS genre, adding Mech combat along-side a futuristic FPS.<br /><br />The Titan combat system is interesting however, it becomes boring quickly, it feels as if the Titan combat system was designed specifically for 12 year olds, with simple point and click actions requiring very little thought.<br /><br />And the match making system is simply shocking, matching level 1's to level 40+'s who have access to a-lot more weapon sets and titan set-ups then the level 1's.<br /><br />Also the 49 GB download size is simply ridicules.<br /><br />Titanfall most defiantly needs a-lot of work done to it to make it play worthy IMO.
