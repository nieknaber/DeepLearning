Downloaded and installed on Vista machine very easily.  Runs very well on my Laptop with good graphics.    Game play was easy to learn and rewarding with fish popping out as you break boxes and move thru the puzzle.  Can get challenging when you near the end of the puzzle trying to break the last few boxes.  Skelton fish on certain maps add additional challenges.  There are 100 puzzles with 50 puzzle bonus pack.    Music can get get repetitive, so I swithed it to waves.     Aquarium screen saver is very nice and you can pick the type and amount of fish you want as differnt species are unlocked when you complete levels.      Of course it has been tough to play as my wife has taken over the Laptop and played the weekend non-stop.    Side note:  It appears the only AV software out there picking up this \\"trojan\\" is AVG.  IMHO, this is a false positive, but it is your computer so please do what you think is best.
