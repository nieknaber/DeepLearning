THIS IS A PC REVIEW ONLY.<br />I can say I've followed EA games through their different series and the Battlefield series were great before now. This one in the hands of EA has been riddled with problems for the PC. I would avoid buying this if you have a newer gaming rig. I've noticed a lack of support from customer service and tech support when I've encountered problems and I've already experienced a hanful of problems since buying it now under a month ago. I regret buying it even at the 50% mark from when it was launched.<br /><br />First of all, the campaign is too short (12 missions - 2 of which aren't really missions at all so you're down to 10 complete missions) and arguably not a challenge. Though on easy it will glitch out at times and make points difficult to pass (like in \\"Rock and a Hard Place\\")<br /><br />Second, the only way to access Battlefield 3 is online. There is no offline mode... but I paid for it? When launching from desktop I encounter Shockwave Flash issues as well as app issues with their program \\"Origin\\" you must run. At times when you try launching ti from the desktop it'll think their are multiple BF3 games launched and will deny access. This becomes troublesome when going from quick match to Quick Match in Multiplayer. See how that works? If you don't properly close Origin it'll deny you access or freeze up my browser, then I have to exit out of everything... This is not my idea of fun. This is flawed programming and it sucks. Multiplayer along with Campaign won't support my \\"High End gaming rig\\" (i7-3770k + Z77 motherboard + GTX 670). Terrain and graphical elements glitch out and the game will sometimes lock up in game, crash to the desktop, or create trees that float in the middle of no where. Sideways Floating Trees that move with your field of vision. How do those work? Don't even get me started on having to accept to their Terms of Agreement every time I launch a Quick Match. It's exasperating all in all. Where is the fun I ask?<br/><br />Buyer beware on PC version. EA has gone downhill.
