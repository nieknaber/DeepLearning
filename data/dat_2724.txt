I was pressured by my peers to get this on launch date but it very much sucked as it was expected, lack of new content, they actually removed existing content (weekly & nightfall) from players who didn't buy the expansion.<br /><br />Shame on you! just blunt greed.<br /><br />Read the other reviews and check &#34;why you shouldn't buy the expansion&#34; on youtube.<br /><br />Don't waste your money, move on
