Playing somewhat like a Match-3 game in reverse, TripleTown has a lot more depth and strategy than many would expect from a casual game. Wrapped in a super cute art style, it is one of the most clever and surprising games I've played in a long time.<br /><br />Easy to learn, hard to master is the best way to describe the gameplay. Instead of the traditional removal of gems, stones, or Chuzzles, TripleTown has you placing various tiles in order to advance up the food chain so to speak. Though this sounds simple on paper, once the board starts filling it becomes an incredible challenge to keep the game going, and really makes you have to think with every move you make.<br /><br />It only took one round for the uncomplicated, but all the same engadging mechanics to have me completely addicted to building my towns, beating my hi-score, and getting rid of those horrid Ninja Bears! Don't let the casual label turn you off, TripleTown is much more than at first meets the eye, and any puzzle fan should absolutely check it out.
