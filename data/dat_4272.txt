I have been an avid BF enthusiast starting with 1942 all the way to BF2.  Have played all the big mods and was super fired up to play this game.  I have 8 gigs of corsair memory and a brand new video card sitting in the box ready to be installed so that I can play BF3.  However, after reading all the reviews about what a pain in the ass the game is to install, the spyware, and all the other hoops you must jump through to get going I am not going to buy.  Thanks for the heads up guys.  I am sure you guys saved me a huge headache.  EA you lost me.  I wrote these comments as someone who was ready to buy but backed off because of the mountain of negative reviews.  EA take note.
