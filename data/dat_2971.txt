I paid $20 less on amazon.com than i would have at any store..i checked all over and this was the cheapest. But i was very skeptical because I have never downloaded a game before, scared to get virus and i took caution at first but ended up giving it a try. I figured i have Norton and thought amazon wouldn't allow viruses and since then I have been playing this game ( very addictive by the way lol) from this download for the past year now and i don't have any issue with it at all!! It Downloaded fairly quickly and i started playing it right away!! Its one great deal as i stated earlier!!
