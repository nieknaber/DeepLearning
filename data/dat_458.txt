Overall The Sims 3 is a fun playing experience, the virtual world is a fun place to explore. The Sims are also nice to create and I feel it's easy to make them look to a person's liking. The game does have its flaws though. From my own experience it takes a considerable amount of time for the game to start and save the game. I can say I have to wait about maybe 9-15 minutes to get into the game at the beginning. I'm talking about the loading screen once you click on the saved town you want to play in not the loading screen at the beginning. Also the amount of time it takes the Sims to satisfy their needs is in my opinion the biggest flaw of this game, well sleeping takes the longest. Even if you fast forward through the action it takes longer than it should if you ask me. I feel if you have to patience if you really want to play this game but is worth it if you have the time to get into it. Also if you play with more than one sim it does help because you can play with another while the other one is sleeping or at work, etc. The Sims 3 is one of my favorite games but it's defiantly not for everyone overall it's a good example of a great life stimulation game.
