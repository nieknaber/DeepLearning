I love this game and the pets are just fanastic.  I am so happy to have this game to my added Sims3 collection.  I love the fact that you can control the pets as well as the sims.  Sometimes I just leave the pets to themselves and they do great by themselves as well.  Like my title says Words Can't Express as this game is AWESOME.
