So, you want to buy this game on Amazon.  No problem, right?  You download stuff all the time, no big deal.  You buy the game.  Easy.  You click download, looks like it downloaded.  But wait - you can't run it.  You should use the Amazon Downloader to download it.  Um, OK.  On you nice, shiny new Windows 8 machine you download that.  So far so good....run it...then boom!  blows up.  Uh...maybe I'll move on to that OTHER thing Amazon tells me I need to get the game I already bought and maybe already downloaded: Steam.<br /><br />Alllllrightythen. Log in to Steam. Gotta create a Steam account.  Sigh. Fill out form.  Fill out form.  Fill out form.  Done.  Yay.  Now the helpful Amazon instructions tell you must click on the &#34;Add Game&#34; button.  Except. There.  Is. No.  &#34;Add Game button&#34;.  Search the web.  Aha!  Users who have gone before you say you must respond to the Steam account confirmation email before anything can happen.  Ok.  Look for confirmation email.  Nothing.  Refresh.  Nope.  Check email address. Refresh.  Nope.  Wait.  Check filters, look at spam folder.  Nope.  Refresh.  Nope.  Go to Steam help.  WTF???!!?  I have to create a SEPARATE Steam Support Account?  Are you serious?  Arrrgghhh. Alright, alright.... Create ANOTHER Steam account for support.  Hey! Look at that! Quick like a bunny confirmation email for the support account pops right into the inbox.  Click on the URL in the email and validate.  Yay!  I have a Steam support account. Now I can report the fact that I never got a Steam account verification email.  Which I do.  And it sits.  So.  I have downloaded a game, I think.  I have downloaded the Amazon downloader that blew up.  I created two (count em - TWO) Steam accounts.  End result?  NO GAME.  No &#34;Add Game&#34; button. NADA. ZIP. Nothing for $30.<br /><br />But here's the fun part: get frustrated (can you tell?) call Amazon support, tell them what an absolute goat rodeo this is, and they say &#34;I am sorry, our policy iswe do not refund for digital downloads.&#34;  WHAT?  &#34;But I am sure Steam will get in touch with you in about three days or so.&#34;  Oh, that's a real relief. This game I purchased instantly I may be able to play in a few days.  Gee, thanks.  Welcome to the digital age, circa 1999.  So, several days later a Steam Support email appears telling me &#34;To activate a CD key on Steam you will need to go to the Games tab and select &#34;Activate a product on Steam&#34;. Well, thank you all to heck.  If I HAD an &#34;Activate a product on Steam&#34; button I WOULD. But I DON&#34;T. Because I NEVER GOT THE ACTIVATION EMAIL.  Which was exactly what my reported support question was: &#34;Never got STEAM account activation Email.&#34; NOT &#34;How do I activate a game&#34;.  Okay. Enough.<br /><br />So, after a while on the line with Amazon, they 'made an exception' (well gee, thanks) and gave me my money back.  Lesson learned: NEVER buy any Amazon digital downloads.
