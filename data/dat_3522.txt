If you are looking for story, exotic environments, or great voice acting, pass this game by.  If you are looking for addictive game play, Diablo-like drops, and all around \\"mindless\\" fun, this is worth it's budget title cost.    I purchased this game after playing a demo.  With no great expectations, I was pleasantly surprised with it's pick up and play nature.
