While getting the game for a good price of $20 I see that after playing the game for two hours that $20 is probably all the game is worth.  The graphics while bad are hardly PS4 quality more like middle ground PS3/Xbox 360 quality the character creation design is sadly abysmal and the combat controls aren't much better.  The voice cast are also sadly lacking as you have a few talented voice actors thrown in with a majority of less talented voice actors/actresses.  The upgrades and crafting are also a sad clone-like attempt of the mentioned games but less helpful or needed sometimes.<br /><br />The enemies are a mix of decent to bad as attacks and blocks are so easy to do half the time that it's understandable why the developers of the game had you fight more then one enemy.  I wasn't expecting much from the game from what a friends and some of the more trusted reviews of the game were saying about it but this was way worse.  If you're still interested in the game wait until another sale or something comes so you can at least get the game for $20 or less anymore and you might feel cheated.
