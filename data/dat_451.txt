This is my 9th review and completed adventure in the Nancy Drew series.<br /><br />First, I'd like to start by dividing my review into two factions.<br />1) The game itself<br />2) My personal detective work.<br /><br />* PART 1 *<br /><br />PLOT: Off to Colorado [2nd best state in the USA btw]! This adventure is based on pure science and, if I am going to tackle any kind of topic in this particular field, I am glad it's Tesla!  I was fascinated and honored to learn more about him [interesting to see his feuding with Edison documented.]  Someone died in the facilities onsite laboratory in Nancy Drew's second murder mystery since HER INT opened its door with SECRETS. Niko Jovic is electrocuted as he is studying wireless electricity transferral and he wished to bring this technology to the world for free! Yes and get rid of all these damn wooden telephone poles and wires that make our landscaping ugly!  Time for pod boxes on each neighborhood corner!<br /><br />INITIAL SCORE: 82<br /><br />CHARACTERS:<br /><br />Mason Quinto: This tool wants credit for his science work and he has Niko checking out his actions days before his death. Messing up his desk was fun and I can't see why he wanted to be a weirdo so much. His facial expressions were odd when he tried to be funny.<br /><br />Ellie York : I had her pegged initially as the culprit because she was missing for half the plot, but I soon cashed in on the real criminal and discovered that this murder mystery mirrored SECRETS in the \\"great reveal\\".<br /><br />Gray Cortright: Epitome of a negative attitude and deserves no friends in life because of it. I really wanted to limit my time with this creature.<br /><br />Ryan Kilpatrick : Has the same warm and crazy personality as Bess [Nancy's friend], but with actual intelligence. I wasn't buying the motive line that the story was trying to sell me with her, because I knew that she was innocent for some reason.<br /><br />Deirdre Shannon:  I hated her in general, but what a wonderful script written for her character by HER INT! The voice acting was at a high level and superbly polished.  I don't know why she was Nancy's phone contact [over George let's say], but the criminology class assignment went with the plot seamlessly.<br /><br />Victor Lossett : Grating! I could see that type of boss in everyday life and it was nice to see it within a storyline like this. Yes, jerks come at all intellectual levels!<br /><br />Frank Hardy and Joe Hardy:  Not as goofy like in past adventures, but they did offer key advisement just when I seemed to need it.<br /><br />CUMUL SCORE: EVEN = 82<br /><br />SCORE/GRAPHICS/SOUND EFFECTS:<br />Very distinctive, scientific electric music! It really brought out the scenes and usually I only pay attention when its a spooky game.  The graphics were polished especially in Niko's private study.  Voice acting was exceptional, but my download had a dialogue/music glitch in the last 7 minutes of game time that really reduced the enjoyment level.<br /><br />CUMUL SCORE: + 4 = 86<br /><br />PUZZLES: These lab work assignments brought up memories of my chemistry classes back in college  ha, ha!<br />I loved most of them except for two key problems I want to mention:<br />1) Even though a review of lab safety makes me want to fall into a comatosed state out of sheer boredom, I do also realize that we must do a service to the children playing this game.  NEVER combine acids with a pour and NEVER pour water directly into an acid. Acids are always poured INTO water. That is a Chemistry 101 rule that should have been emphasized and perhaps been a cause of injury in the game if you performed it wrong.<br />2) Though i love a hard puzzle, this timed puzzle business was extremely overdone. I mean I wanted to learn how to complete the schematics at the end, but I couldn't even concentrate because I had a few minutes before I was electrocuted. If I didn't cheat for  these answers, this would have gone on for over an hour and Iwould have died twenty times. I would have learned absolutely nothing about fuses, capacitors, and diodes except frustration. This should have been planned better; perhaps NOT an end puzzle and placed in the story so I could learn what I was actually doing.<br /><br />CUMUL SCORE: - 1 = 85<br /><br />ENDING: I was happy I solved the mystery, but was extremely disappointed for two reasons:<br />1) I was enticed into thinking I was going to be riding snowmobiles in the Colorado blizzard and it never happened :(<br />2) The end story explanative was so rushed I couldn't even get down what they were saying. HER INT  should have included a rewind feature so I could relisten to it all again. I mean, THIS is the juiciest part of the story and I missed half of it trying to process the first couple sentences. Tooooo fast guys!<br /><br />CUMUL SCORE:  + 1 = 86<br /><br />* PART 2 *<br /><br />I try to solve cases without any hints, walkthroughs, etc, even if it were to<br />take weeks! Well, it took me 362 days  [10 game hours in total] and I gave myself a<br />Detective Score Of : 52<br /><br />My Strong Points: I guessed the culprit & answered 85% of the puzzles rather easily.<br /><br />My Weak Points: I had to look at the walkthrough about seven times because I was bogged down in TOO much science and had trouble understanding what I had to do next. Many things I attempted [like searching for Niko's fingerprint] weren't even ready yet although the game mentioned it had to be performed! It wasn't my fault, but I guess I really had a high frustration level and it showed. This was my worst physical detective work I ever had playing ND games. For the life of me, I couldn't connect with HER INT wanting me to use binary codes continually, but I applaud them for being technical anyhow.<br /><br />OVERALL GAME SCORE: 86 + 52/ 2 = 69 [ D plus ]<br /><br />BOTTOMLINE: It wasn't actually a bad story from a learning perspective, but beyond that, gameplay wasn't that intriguing to be honest. One of the worst intro trailers ND has put out too. Based on my constant irritations about the puzzles not being explained or rushed into with a timing device [forcing easy deaths upon you],  I have to say the game ran a little clunky. [Interface was superb however.]<br /><br />Thus far, on my list of the 21 completed ND games, DEVICE ranks....# 20 !!!!!!<br /><br />1) GHOST DOGS OF MOON LAKE * 88.5<br />2) THE SHATTERED MEDALLION * 87<br />3) GHOST OF THORNTON HALL * 86.5<br />4) HAUNTING CASTLE MALLOY * 85.5<br />5) TREASURE ROYAL TOWER * 84<br />6) HAUNTED CAROUSEL * 83<br />7) WHITE WOLF ICICLE CREEK * 82.5<br />8) DANGER DECEPTION ISLAND * 81<br />9) MESSAGE HAUNTED MANSION * 80<br />10) WARNINGS AT WAVERLY * 78<br />11) SHADOW AT WATER'S EDGE * 77.5<br />12) THE CAPTIVE CURSE * 77<br />13) SECRET SHADOW RANCH * 76<br />14) TRAIL OF THE TWISTER * 72<br />15) PHANTOM OF VENICE * 71.5<br />16) TOMB OF THE LOST QUEEN * 71<br />17) THE SILENT SPY * 70.5<br />18) CURSE BLACKMOOR MANOR * 70<br />19) ALIBI IN ASHES * 69.5<br />20) THE DEADLY DEVICE * 69<br />21) SECRETS CAN KILL [REMAST] * 68ned better; perhaps NOT an end puzzle and placed in the story so I could learn what I was actually doing.
