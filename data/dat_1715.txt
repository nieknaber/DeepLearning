We like this game.  So far it is different than some of the others, yet feels new and refreshing.  It seems to have a mix bag of different adventures and puzzles to do.  When the Lego City game came out I was disappointed it only came to the Wii U because I wanted to play some city action.  We'll the first level does not disappoint because it plays like lego city.  Love it!  The game seems to follow the movie exactly.  I do have to watch it at times with the kids and mute some of the more colorful words they used just like in the film, but there's not too many.<br /><br />This is the fourth game I've bought and downloaded from Steam with no problems.  The first time was challenging figuring it out but after that it has been real simple and they've all worked flawlessly.<br /><br />Would recommend this game!
