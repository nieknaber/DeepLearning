I love the HO and puzzle games that have a bit more of an adult theme to them.  This one, like the other Twisted Lands game, [[ASIN:B004CYEOTI Twisted Lands: Shadow Town [Download]]], was challenging without being impossible and had really great animation and creepy cut scenes.  Lots of fun to play!
