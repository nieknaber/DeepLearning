Simcity cannot work on dell laptops with switchable graphics using AMD GPU (HD7730 with Intel HD 4000).  Such configuration are not uncommon. How did the beta testing missed it is just unfathomable. At least I got the refund but I have wasted two days of my life reinstalling windows 7 and all my graphic drivers as per EA's advisors. Please next time TEST YOUR PRODUCT PROPERLY FIRST ! Dont waste our time !
