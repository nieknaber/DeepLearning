The other night I had a dream that my sons and I were in the mansion from Scratches and they had a huge wrench (ah, the ubiquitous wrench) and were trying to open the secret door in the fireplace. I knew there was a monster down there and I was trying to stop my sons from going and didn’t know what to do, so I woke up! That is how profoundly affected I’ve been from this game which I’ve played twice. It is truly suspenseful and I have the clenched jaw to prove it.<br />With the exception of the 360 degree effect (that sometimes makes people dizzy) everything else is wonderful. The game takes place inside and outside the mansion, so it is never tedious. I really like the main character’s voice, the graphics (although some may feel that they are too dark), the story line (what a surprise toward the end), the additional story that continues a few years later, and everything else about the game including the tasks that are quite do-able for the not-so-experienced Adventure gamer<br />It is well worth the money and time. I’m Romani (Gypsy) and my gran always told me to look out the window after waking from a bad dream and you will not remember it . I forgot to do that but if you dream of the game, don’t forget!
