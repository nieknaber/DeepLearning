Just saying, I made the bad mistake of thinking that a digital download was compatible with my disc base game and I was wrong. So if you have the digital download of the Sims 3 then this will work for you! If not then don't spend your money. I got a refund which was nice when I explained that it was not compatible. DO NOT MAKE THE MISTAKE I MADE! But keep on simming simmers.
