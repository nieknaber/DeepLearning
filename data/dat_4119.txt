Probably the best Tower Defense game I've ever played (yes, even better than pixeljunk monsters, which was my previous favorite) - my brother and I have been playing this for hour after hour, and it isn't looking like we're gunna be stopping anytime soon. Unless if you only enjoy generic FPSs or sports games or something, and like a little thinking-based / competitive gameplay, definitely get this!
