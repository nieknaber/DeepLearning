I didn't have a single problem downloading, installing, or connecting to the servers.  It's a fun, game and I do like that you have the option to start your own group of cities and build it up or join with other players and work with them to build your city.<br /><br />Honestly, I was worried when I purchased this because of all the reviews but I was very pleasantly surprised.<br /><br />UPDATE***  While I have never had a problem connecting to the servers or playing the game, it's honestly not very exciting.  After a while it just feels like you're doing the same thing over and over again.  I suppose any game gets boring after a period of time but I've never tired of a Sims brand game so quickly before.
