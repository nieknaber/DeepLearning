tried to install it from the pc download and failed after 8hr download. I found where the files were placed on my pc and tried to run them. Installer crashed saying something about a dos 16 ntvdm failure. no mention of ntvdm on their support web site and support is apparently volunteer.     Update on next day: re-installed direct-x and downloaded again. This time it worked and my son is enjoying the game now.
