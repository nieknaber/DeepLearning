Ok so first off this was another game I saw reviewed on Toonami that I thought looked good. Now I didn't purchase this game from Amazon I bought straight from the psn store. Anyway basically the player starts off as Monroe a boy who wakes up to discover his beloved swan is missing. Armed with paint balls you set off on an adventure that requires platforming and puzzle solving no combat at all. I've seen it compared to Journey and I agree that it is like that in the wandering around aspect of it.  I would recommend it to anyone who wants a different style of gaming besides combat games. The music will have you stopping to listen and the graphics will have you exploring everything. All in all it's very fun even though it is short. But there's always room for a replay :D
