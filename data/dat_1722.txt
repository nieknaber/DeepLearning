I know Im a bit behind the times, but I dont like spending lots of money on the newest thing. So when this was on sale for just $7, i knew I had to buy it. I loved the Mass Effect series and with the (wonderfully free) DLC addition to the ending the games are tied off nicely. It has been a wonderful ride and I am happy yet sorry to see such an awesome game series come to an end.
