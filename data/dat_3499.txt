There is a ton of EA hate, some justified, some bandwagon hate. This just leaves no doubt that EA is a scum of a company and deserves to burn. I tried contact EA support who said I cannot get a refund simply because I bought from &#34;third party&#34; walmart. Why the heck would that make any difference, ALL the copies are linked to Origin and the physical copy is just a bloody unlock key. I could not even get Origin credit!<br /><br />So screw Origin, screw EA, and screw anyone who supports them by continuing to buy their games after this.
