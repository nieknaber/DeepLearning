The game is fun, and slightly unique, for a mmo.  There were a few ups and downs.  Ups: free to play, unique talent/skill obtainment, story generated content.  Downs: the classes, while different, all feel somewhat the same until later levels.  The end game, so far, consists of grinding out crafting or dungeons for gear with no new raids released yet.  Exploration is supposed to be a high point, but also feels a little grindy once level capped.  I know a few people that are defending all the down sides but, while they aren't game breaking, they don't add value to the long term progression of play within the game.<br /><br />Overall, I gave it 4 stars.  The game is fun and you will probably enjoy it.  While there isn't a lot of fun end game stuff to do now, there may be in the near future.  Since it is a free to play game, you can always come back to it 6-12 months down the line once that content is added.
