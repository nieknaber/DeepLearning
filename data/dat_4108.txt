FFXIV is one of the best MMOs I've played in years.  Not since the days of City of Heroes have I been so immersed in an online game.  It's casual friendly, yet has some very interesting mechanics for the hardcore group.  Unfortunately, many of these mechanics are forced upon all players as they progress through the game, but if you mention you are new to whatever it si you are running, many of the groups are very supportive and help with the learning process.  There are many classes and jobs to pick from and you can change between them on the fly, after you've unlocked them of course.  And once you hit 50 (current max level), a whole world of content opens up for you.  The community is very good, for the most part.  There are a few rotten eggs here and there, but that's to be expected in any online world.  Overall, this is an excellent and often overlooked game.  It's one place I plan to stay a part of for quite some time.
