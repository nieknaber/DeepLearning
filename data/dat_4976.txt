While it's not super realistic, it is a fun sniper game.  I tend to focus on the sniping part, but it also has a stealth component.  When compared to games like Hitman, Call of Duty, MoH, Battlefield, it's not nearly as polished.  The actions are a little clunky.  However, what makes this game is the kill shots.  Very cool bullet time effect.  The story seems good as well.
