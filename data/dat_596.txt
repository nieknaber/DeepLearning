Game codes easily redeem on steam.  Make sure you're buying this version, the online code.  You can go to Steam -> Games -> Product Key and paste it in there, and it adds it.<br /><br />While I understand this utilizes SecuROM (online activation), $7.49 for both Bioshocks (the price right now) is more than fantastic.  We need more deals like this for older games.  You're buying the game anyway so it shouldn't matter what security since you bought the games.  But then again, I don't have virtual drives or Nero so I don't have any problems.
