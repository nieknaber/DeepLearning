This is one of those games that uses a known name to get you to purchase it and then totally disappoints.<br />The only redeeming factor is that for $7.00 I was able to be occupied for a short period of time.<br />The object graphics were poorly done and the mini games were not entertaining.<br />SPOILER ALERT******<br />One example of how badly conceived this game is the following. In one location you are told that you need to find parts for your computer to be usable. I was able to find everything but the computer mouse, when I decided to use a hint to locate the mouse, the hint proved itself useless because its' response was to tell me that I needed to find the mouse. That was so asinine as to be laughable.<br />Don't waste your money as I did.
