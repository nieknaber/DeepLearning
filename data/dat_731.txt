I only played halfway before I got bored and frustrated with this game. My main issues are that they removed the fun aspects of the first two games and added more difficulty. I really miss the ability to customize weapons in cool ways. The six shooter shotgun in 2 was my favorite FPS weapon of all time. They also removed the multiple kinds of ammo. Another thing they removed is any minigames like hacking. I liked the first game's hacking the best, but the second one's was cool to. This one you just find lockpicks. They have made this game very vanilla, which makes it boring and reptitive.<br />  The new powers are kind of cool, but that only lasts for so long. The world itself is very cool, but it too becomes reptitive. That and I found some of the enemies way to difficult to defeat because you have to hit them in specific places and new enemies spawn repeatedly. You couldn't set traps or cycle ammo to do more damage.<br />  I feel like they removed the fun to appeal more to hardcore gamers.
