I just purchased this on 3/28/2013 and withing in 20 minutes of buying it on Amazon I had it downloaded, patched, and was creating a city. I waited a few weeks after release knowing it was going to be another Diablo3. In the fact that it has an always online DRM and the servers wouldn't be able to handle the initial loads. As of now the servers are amazing, there are no wait times. And for those that hate the fact that you have to always be online to play. Get over it. The DRM is doing its job. You cannot find a \\"cracked\\" copy of this game on any torrent site. So that means more money in the creators pocket allowing for better servers, updates, and support.<br /><br /> Now for the game. It is everything I expected. A lot of people are complaining about the small city sizes. Well the creator has already realeased a message stating that the city sizes will get larger with updates. Also with this being said. The game isn't city based anymore. It is region based. Meaning that you have multiple cities in one area. With this you have the ability to task out your cities. One can be your tourist city, another your recource city that provides all the cities with power and water, and another your service city providing law enforcement and other pubilc services. You have the choice to allow other people to manage these cities or you can step up to the challenge and be the Mayor of 3-X amount of cities. The game has come a long way since the other Sim Cities. It now has free zoning, water and power run through the city streets, and being online you and your friends can create cities in the same region.<br /><br />The game also gives you the option to use the Sandbox mode. So if the cities are not big enough for you. Use that and create a massive region.<br /><br />I look foward to playing this game more and more. Along the way I hope to meet some people who enjoy this game as I do and we can create some amazing things.<br /><br />I hope this review was helpful to anyone who reads it and look forward to any comments on it.ds it and look forward to any comments on it.
