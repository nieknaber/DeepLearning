I'm not usually a fan of these time management games, but this one lets you play \\"casual\\" style so you aren't actually on the clock if you don't want to be. I loved it! I played it every night until I finished it. Great fun. In the sessions when you have to grow crops to make pies or the like, beware of those pesky rabbits that get into the crops! Well worth the money.
