It took me 5 times just to download the game using Amazon's \\"Crysis 2 Downloader\\". Every time, when I'd get to the end of downloading the giant 9.5GB file, it would find some error and start ALL over. The resume doesn't seem to work if there's an error. That's about 50GB of data downloaded before I was able to play the game.<br /><br />Afterwards, I wasn't able to play the game on an nVidia GT 540M graphics card. It just doesn't run with EA's launcher. I ended up re-downloading the game on another computer with a Geforce 6800 GT. It runs, but the water effects don't render correctly. The moment I walk into water, I fall through the level, making it unplayable. I've tried various graphics settings with no fix. I've scrounged the technical forums. (EA tech support sucks.)<br /><br />1 year later, I'm trying this again with completely updated drivers. The same thing is happening.<br /><br />I give up. I'm sticking with Steam.
