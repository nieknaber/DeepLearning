Horribly over hyped and over priced dreck. By the time you reach either the monster or humans you are just spamming the same buttons... No skill, or thought put into the attack... You drop in and run forward and there is nothing else to do. The game is anemic on content, with little to no side jobs or thought put into interacting with the environment. The monster always sits and waits and the hunters always just spam sprint and leave everyone else behind. Its 15 minutes of boredom followed by either an unbalanced monster kill or an insta death. The game sucks. End of story.<br /><br />It'd take an entire team of people working together perfectly and even then you die in four or five monster attacks. And he's faster than you. If anyone is even halfway decent as the monster then they win.<br /><br />And I played a few matches where it wasn't even a full lobby. So there were two AI hunters which weren't helpful at all against the monster.<br /><br />Everyone I know who had played it has pretty just strongly disliked itï»¿
