Let me start off by saying my first MMO that I played for about 6 years was Everquest. That game was unforgiving. The penalties were harsh and the content was hard. However, given all those flaws it's the one game that I remember the most and loved the most. I played many MMO's over the years. World of Warcraft, Rift, Everquest 2, DC online, SWTOR, LOTRO, and Dungeons and dragons online. I think I know the genre pretty well.<br /><br />I know there have been people who had technical issues and account hacking issues. I feel bad for those people but personally I've not had a single problem at all since day 1. I did receive a few \\"password change attempt emails\\" but I ignored them. Haven't been hacked. The game plays really well even on my outdated video card which ran Wow pretty well.<br /><br />The end of the backstory. I'll start my review of the game:<br /><br />This game is probably the most fun I've had in an MMO in a really long time. It just feels epic. I love the feeling I get when i'm helping out a local (whoever) doing my thing and suddenly i'm alerted to the fact that some crazy stuff is about to go down. I see dozens of creatures suddenly attacking the local populace. Alone I fear for my life so I fall back into the relative safety of the nearby settlement and attempt as I can to defend their lives. Suddenly over a nearby hill I see a group of charging friendlies to bolster my defense. Together we beat back the attackers and win the day as the cowards who attacked us in numbers run away. Shortly after we go on the offensive and attack those guys back. After we decimate their forces we face thier leader who falls before our combined might.<br /><br />There are so many cool things about this. First is the fact that I didnt have to join a group or a raid in which to participate in this event. Just being there was enough to experience this. I felt useful as I cut down foe after foe and buffed my allies around me.<br /><br />The combat in this game is lovely and I believe it's very deep. there are so many choice to make on how to build your character. I know it's not quite as deep as guild wars 1 was but it's a lot more so then any of the other MMOs.<br /><br />The world itself is breathtakingly beautiful. I spend almost all of my time just exploring. Hunting for hidden areas and the fun and sometimes frustrating jumping puzzles.<br /><br />Now dungeons.....I have a love/hate relationship with these. I have almost always played a melee class. I love to do it. Always have. However dugeons in this game hate melee. I mean I personally believe it hate them more then any other MMO out there even in a raiding environment. It's really hard to play effectively as a melee in these cases. It's possible and I'm not saying it's not but it's just very hard to do so and you will die a lot. However, the one thing I love about the dungeons is that they are so hard to accomplish correctly. I really feel a sense of accomplishment when I complete them. Even ones I've already done I still feel good when it's over.<br /><br />I love the innovation in the game to think outside the box as far as going away from the traditional roles but I think because they did this it limits their gameplay. If I want to play a warrior all toughened up with skyrocketed hit points I really should feel tough instead of like a cardboard box. (to be fair anyone who isn't speced that way is like wet tissue paper but still) I think maybe they tried to stray tooooooo far from the traditional roles that they made some playstyles invalid. I don't think I should be able to just stand around and just soak damage but one hit shouldn't take a 1/4 of my life either.<br /><br />WVW is pretty fun. I haven't played it much though. I did all the exploring in them including jumping puzzles and some actual pvp as I was exploring but I think I'll probably play a lot more of this once I complete my total map exploration. Currently at 75% of total exploration done.<br /><br />SPVP Idid in beta and I had a lot of fun with that but \\"I think\\" it doesn't help you out in anyway in PVE so it takes a backseat for me for now.<br /><br />All in all I really do love the game. I love the exploration. I love the detail they put into the game from underwater combat to the little side areas like secret gardens. I love the combat.<br /><br />I do wish there were more playstyle options but then I think if they did open it up some more people would just gravitate back to tank/dps/healer roles so I understand why it's not there.<br /><br />Hopefully this will help some of you on the fence about buying get it. It's a very well put together game and without a monthly fee it's definitely worth it. I've already gotten more playtime out of this game then 3 of any other single player games out there.
