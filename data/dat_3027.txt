I would recommend you DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!<br /><br />If you look at the EA forums, you will find countless people having the same issue I did with it. It stalls on install, it stalls when opening to do updates (it took me 9 times through updates and force quitting when it would freeze until it loaded), and it freezes on the title screen. EA should not make games that require internet, with no offline capability; especially when their servers are the weakest I have ever seen! I am so disgusted that I wasted my money on this!
