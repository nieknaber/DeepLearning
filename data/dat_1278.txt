I wanted to give this game a try saw some good reviews, so I tried to download it...never worked, so I bought a used one and had I hard time with that,( Kept turning off)  I downloaded this twice because I was enjoying the game, then I saw somewhere you need to have EA downloaded on your computer, so I did that...IT WORKED>> I am enjoying playing this game but one thing I can never get connected with EA to play online but you can play offline.  GREAT GAME more of a Role playing type.
