This is like most SimCity games that I've played. But as everyone knows there was issues with the game first game out that there was many connection issues. I also see that there is a lack of players online and this maybe due to the starting issues for the game. I also dont like that I have to be online to play a game I payed for.<br />If you don't mind playing online or with other people I would suggest buying this.
