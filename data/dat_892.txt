Should have done some more research before I bought this.  I have the regular version for xbox, decided to pick this up for all the DLC included and to have it on the PC platform.  However no one plays online, and even if you do find a match, lag is basically unplayable.  Do not purchase if your goal is to play online.<br /><br />That said, single player is great if you've never done it.  And local 2 player/versus is fine.  Its a great game, however i purchased it specifically to play online and the option may as well not exist for how bad it is.
