You need this for multiplayer gaming on the PS4. The benefits other than needing it for the PS4 is two free games a month. You don't pick them, Sony does and they tend to have indies, or semi popular games. When I originally bought this was for my PS4 on Nov 2013 since then the library of games have grown. If by chance you have a PS3 or vita then they also get two free games a month.
