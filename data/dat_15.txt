I am new to first-person shooter video gaming. I'm 60 years old and grew up in the military. This product is excellent - it's well researched and very entertaining. Even though this is game has been on the market for years, and may be considered &#34;old-school&#34; by younger people it is still fun to play and was priced right. I will definitely be adding games from this series to my collection soon. I can't wait to see the Modern Warfare offerings.
