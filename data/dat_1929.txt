Graphics & gameplay are top notch, plays great on my Acer Predator U222 gaming PC with all the settings maxed out!<br /><br /> Although I can play it in 3D Vision on single 24&#34; 120hz monitor or 40&#34; 3DTV, I find the game looks best in regular HD or 4k displays... I however decided to dedicate a SoftTH profile to this splendid game from Activision and run it across all 3 of my displays at once! SoftTH is one of the coolest PC programs ever made, and when using the Widescreen Fixer (another free program) to correct the field of view in Transformers WFC, the game looks awesome output on my tri-display which is one 40&#34; Sharp 3DTV in landscape mode for the center display, and two 24&#34; LCD Monitors attached to either sides of the 40&#34; TV in portrait mode for a combined resolution of 3648 x 1152! SoftTH takes ANY monitor setup, any configuration and uses a logic calculator to appropriately stretch ANY game across the displays... It is free, make sure you also download both Widescreen Fixer and Flawless Widescreen as these can help with field of view and menu errors. :'D<br /><br />The game itself is very well done, the physics, targeting and cut scenes are a pleasure to experience, just don't expect to find ANYTHING human or organic, cause the whole game takes place on Cybertron and there is no green there at all.  :p
