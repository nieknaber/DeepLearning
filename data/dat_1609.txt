Immediately after purchasing and downloading the newest Sims 3 Stuff pack from Amazon I sensed something was amiss. The file download size was 2 to 3 times smaller then any of the other Sims 3 stuff packs I had purchased before, but I presumed perhaps they had made it more efficient and smaller using different compression techniques, oh boy was I wrong. Opening up the folder for everything from this pack I was immediately disappointed at the general lack of quantity. This is by far the smallest stuff pack to yet come out but it is still the same price as the others. The quality of the items was fine as usual but I just could not get past the fact that I paid $20 for a set of about 24 things. There are bigger collections for download on the Sims 3 site! Honestly, if you want a Sims 3 stuff pack, buy High End Loft or Outdoor Life, they have far more items for about the same price.
