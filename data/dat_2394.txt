I am an adult and I actually enjoyed this game!  It reminds me of my old school Nintendo games.  Its simple, and there is no violence, which I like.  Its like Animal Crossing meets Green Acres meets Old School Nintendo.<br />One night I played it so long that my laptop died (it wasn't plugged in!) and I was so upset because nothing I did was saved!!!<br />I think Kids 7-14 and Adults with young kids and those wanting some nostaliga will enjoy this game!
