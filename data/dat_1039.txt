Update: 7/18/2011  NEW PATCH 1.1.0.6 has improved and fixed many items in the game. I will provide specifics at a later time but at least UIG is taking the game in the right direction. Good job UIG!          Update: As of 6/14/2011 the game has not been updated from patch 1.1.0.4 and the bugs have not been fixed. The official forum for the game had moderators that are very dictatorial and condesending to many users that post questions and comments there. The game appears to be headed for the dollar bin if the level of support is used as an indicator.    Hi,     I've tried this game and it's full of bugs.. .graphic and game play related.   If you visit the publishers \\"English\\" forum ( [...] ) they do say that they are working on patches for the game but the bottom line here is that the game was released prematurely and did not receive the proper beta testing. It's really hard to say when if ever they will have the game working properly.      The game has good potential but as of patch 1.1.0.4 it is still in need of fairly major repair.     While I really like the \\"look\\" of this game if you want a more mature product in the same genre have a look at Farming Simulator 2011 here on Amazon. It has tons of addons and they've really got it to the point where the program is working well compared to Agrar Simulator.     Craig
