BioShock Infinite is a marvel in every sense of the word. The shooting feels really great this time around, even in highly dangerous situations. The lore of Infinite was something I actually wanted to explore more when I was done with the game, as you don't get the whole story by just playing the game. Rather, it begs you to look around the world of Infinite because there might be something you need just around the corner. Speaking to this, I have to say that Infinite makes you once again feel like a stranger in a distant place and I love that about this game. Even in downloadable form, this game should be played by every game at least once in their lifetime.
