The 11th Hour is too damn difficult that I've given up playing it. It's the Mouse Trap puzzle that drove me insane like the Microscope Puzzle in The 7th Guest. I have a feeling it's also unsolvable due to the CPU processing speed. There is no fun in playing a game that tortures me endlessly. Being forced to watch the intro over and over is too much for me to take. All in all, just say no to any more sequels like this.
