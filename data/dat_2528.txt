The game itself? Great. Fun gameplay, gorgeous scenery, innovative job and leveling system... you'll enjoy it for the first 30-days. (It comes with a 30 day free trial)<br /><br />After that? Try as you might, it's seemingly impossible for a good chunk of people to successfully subscribe to play. Their subscription system bounces order after order in a row. It doesn't matter the type of card... Debit or Credit, Visa or Mastercard, 1-month or 6-month. No matter what you try, you can't renew... and customer service can't and won't help. (Don't take my word for it: Search the internet for &#34;FF XIV error code 401&#34; and you'll see the dozens of pages of locked forum threads demanding some sort of resolution for months)<br /><br />There's no point in playing a MMO you can only access for 30 days. It's borderline theft. Don't invest your time and energy into a game that you probably won't be able to play... and even if you're one of the lucky ones that CAN, there's little chance the game will stay afloat and update when they continue to push costumers away at this speed.<br /><br />TLDR- Find something else to spend your time and money on.
