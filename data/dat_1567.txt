I don't even know why I bought this game.  I guess just to see what all the fuss was about.  People rant and rave about how great this game is, and I think sometimes people just enjoy the ride quality of the bandwagon.  The game was a horribly ugly port to PC, the devs couldn't even be bothered to make the game look good by PC standards, so some modder quickly put together a hack to bump up the visuals in the game.  That at least made the visuals go from being too ugly to bring out in front of company, to just regular ugly.  A couple hours into the game and I don't get much of a storyline, there's not much in the way of dialogue, and all I've done is go from one area to the next, killing annoyingly cheap monsters.  Yeah yeah, there's the huge dragon near the beginning of the game that kills you in maybe two, three hits tops.  Once you figure out the right way to attack him, it's no biggie, but aside from that, the controls are dreadful.  When you are attacking a foe, you have to make sure the analog stick is aimed just so, and if the foe moves the slightest bit, you have to readjust--your character does not lock onto the character you're attacking so it feels a bit clumsy. Also, the skeletons can take one last cheap shot at you as they're falling to the ground, &#34;dying&#34;.  That is annoying as well, since you can't afford to lose energy b/c if you die and get resurrected, all the enemies you've killed are resurrected as well.  The game is very grainy and abysmal looking, with very uninspired visuals, and with not much of a story (so far) I just can't force myself to be tortured any further. I doubt I will bother with this game anymore.  It barely feels like an RPG and more like a 3-D version of Final Fight, except way more difficult, uglier, and even less rewarding.  I wish I could get my 6 dollars back.
