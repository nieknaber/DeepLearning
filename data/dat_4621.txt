One of the best RPGs made in a while.  I was hesitant because I did not get in to Witcher 2- it was way too linear and straight forward.  Witcher 3 is a total 180 from that.  Very rich, realistic world.  If you like any RPGs, you gotta try this one!  Great character personality development and detail, intricate (almost too much so) plot, good leveling system.  I like Elder Scrolls type open world games where I can roam, this is the most important aspect of a good RPG to me...  Witcher 3 has all the joy of doing that, except everything is not leveled to you, so you will occasionally get ravaged by much higher level monsters.  However, you will find lots of entertaining side quests, so don't skip out on the exploration aspect of this game.<br />The only thing some people may not like is the pace of this game.  It is occasionally slow.  Don't let this bother you.  Just get used to the slower pace.  Actually read the notice boards, go through all the dialogue choices and actually listen to them, do the side quests.  Read the bestiary and actually plan for the next beast slaying.  Pretend you're reading a book and just enjoy the world of Witcher 3.  You won't regret it.
