This is my first big size pc download game from Amazon.  The process from ordering it on amazon.com through loading it up to play the game is somewhat a hassle, and I am not a novice on using computer.   After downloading it (you need amazon downloader which will ask you to download if your a first time user), I was asked to download/install the mandatory Origin program by EA. Also, you need to register an account to use it.  Once finished, it didn't detect my BF3 game.  I guess you need to manually install BF3 on where the Origin can detect it which I did.  I went to my amazon bf3 downloaded folder and extracted bf3.zip to the origin folder (mine was C://Program Files(x86)/Origin Games ) I restarted the Origin program and finally detected the BF3 game.  Once detected,  it ask me to install it which will take a few more minutes.  Once installed and launching the game, it asked me to download/install another mandatory browser plugin in order to play the game.  I have chrome browser and it worked perfectly with it.  After that, its gaming time.  Playing the game is very nice.  Right now I just started campaign and it looks beautiful.  The game is great, but the required programs and plugin in order to play it is a big hassle.  I have no idea why they make it complicated.  I guess EA is trying to match Steam.  For people not that familiar with a computer, will have some problem from ordering it from amazon to playing the game.  I think it will be better to download the game directly from the Origin program and not through amazon.  You can get the product code you ordered from amazon.com on your digital items account and redeem it on Origin.
