Every time I played it with my friends one of us would get disconnected with the error &#34;connection to host has been lost&#34;. This has something to do with the game's network, as it was in the first game as well. The gameplay seems fun, but the whole reason I bought this game was I thought I could have an error-free experience with my friends.
