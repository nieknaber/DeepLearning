The beauty of any Sid Meier game is its ability to immerse you in its environment and make you care what happens.  This is certainly the case with this, the fifth iteration of his popular Civilization series.  Should I start my civilization on a coastal square and become a naval power, or head inland to those mountains full of silver and other riches which will help me buy influence with the other players (or AI's) whom I'll eventually encounter?  Makes a difference, and the difference will depend largely on your personality (at least as expressed in strategic, turn-based computer games).  Note: This is not a &#34;first person&#34; shoot-'em-up or auto race---here you have a bird's-eye view of the entire continent and can choose to be as diplomatic or as aggressive as you feel is appropriate to the particular circumstance.  It's great for new players because there are 10 levels of increasing difficulty, starting with super-easy (Settler).  I myself can usually win at Level 3 (Warlord), but woe betide me if I try Level 4 (Prince)---I seem to be in a struggle for survival from the get-go.  A very involving way to pass a few hours!
