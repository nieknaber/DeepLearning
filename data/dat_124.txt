I don't know why but I've always had a thing for submarine games.  As an adult I don't really have a lot of time to play these days, but I recently purchased Silent Hunter 5 on a whim.  How dissapointed was I?  Very!  Many of the basic functions of the game do not work and you'll soon grow tired of firing on a ship and seeing your torpedo fly off into the sea.  The game is so bad that a large network of modders have grown around it, since ubisoft refused to address many of the issues.  The mods are pretty clever and do improve the mechanics and asthetics of the game, but...  damn, yo.  I you're going to make a game at least make it function.  I wouldn't buy this again.  Well maybe if I was a modder.  Imagine this game as a broken down old car.  If you have the time and inclination to fix it up, go for it.  If you want a game that you can play, probably better to look elsewhere.
