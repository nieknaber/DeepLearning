This game is essentially broken and little has been done to address the numerous issues it's had since launch. I've played both the Playstation 4 and Playstation 3 versions and the PS3 version is almost unplayable for anything but TDM. Maps are too large for such a small number of players.<br /><br />The game itself is inconsistent and glitchy. You'll be killed from 500m with one shot from an LMG, but two perfectly placed sniper shots will not get you a kill. There is constant &#34;rubber banding&#34; and spawn issues. EA says they've addressed them, but they persist.<br /><br />It's also a good idea to avoid this game just to avoid supporting a company like EA. They've ripped off their customers for years and have pushed out mediocre NFL games (they have a monopoly on the NFL license). They also WILL NOT budge if you've purchased a product from them that could be transferred to a different system. I wanted to downgrade my premium membership from PS4 to PS3 and they refused to do it. Never mind that I had already spent $150 on one game (Ps3 + Ps4 + Ps4 Premium).<br /><br />I made a huge mistake when doing this. Avoid this game. I've avoiding buying EA for years before this game came out, and it all came back to me why I was avoiding them.
