I'd imagine the download would work if you bought and activated the original version through steam too. If you bought a disc version or downloaded it from another source, you'll have to buy it again from steam before you can activate the expansion. It's kind of a headache I know, but if someone would have explained that to me an hour ago I never would have purchased it so I thought I'd try to do the next person a favor.
