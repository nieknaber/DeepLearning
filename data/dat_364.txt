Have played World of Warcraft since 2006, and was a loyal player until Cataclysm started ruining the game and Mists just killed it, players became so nasty and disgusting toward each other it just made playing the game repulsive. GW2 was recommended to me and it has exceeded my expectations, The game encourages players to help each other and prevents them from being able to do much of anything to harm one anothers play experience. PVP is excellent and the game is so much more visually stunning than WoW it's like comparing Loony Toons to Avatar. Cancelled my WoW sub and haven't looked back, this game is fantastic.
