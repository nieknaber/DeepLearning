I became intrigued with this game online and decided to buy it.  This is the first time I ever downloaded a video game.  I enjoy the game because of its beautiful graphics, the music, the gradual increase in difficulty and, quite honestly, the history lessons.  It may sound corny but I really feel like I'm traveling.  It's a really nice distraction from the day to day world.<br /><br />Addendum:  Sadly, this game had some kind of bug in it.  I would not purchase again.
