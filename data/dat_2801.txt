I love this game! I wish more people gave this game a shot, and maybe they would love it too. I haven't been this addicted to a game since Left 4 Dead, which is fitting since this is developed by the same guys, but seriously try this game out, after playing for a while and getting the hang of the classes, it will probably sink it's claws into you, just like it did to me.
