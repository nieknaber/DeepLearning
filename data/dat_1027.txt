Bioshock 1: easy to put the steam code, fast download, but it does't lauch. Lucky I bought this on sale. I'm happy I already had 2. I was going to gift it, but now I'm scared it doesn't work for my friend.<br /><br />EDIT: I fixed it with compatibility Windoes 2000. Strange but I hope useful for someone else.
