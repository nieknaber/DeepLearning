Game sounded appealing, but lost its appeal.  It continually locked up, and even the escape key wouldn't unlock it. Kept having to do a manual logoff (CTRL,Alt,Delete) and restart of the computer. There were other problems, also, and I ended up uninstalling it within a week of getting it. Computer is Windows 7 Premium.
