So for $9 you get 6 games. which is a good deal by itself. but when 4 of those games are A list titles that have gotten mostly excellent reviews and are great family games? thats even a better deal. Cars 2 is a mario kart racer type game that is almost too good to be true. Way better than the film. Toy story 3 is perfect. the perfect game for the perfect movie.<br /><br />I havent played any of the rest yet, but Ive heard excellent reviews for lego pirates & disney universe.<br /><br />as for the other two? pirates 3 and Gforce? probably B list titles, but those are even worth a few hours of fun
