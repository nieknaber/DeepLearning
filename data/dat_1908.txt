I won't spend time talking about how good the game is because by now you have probably heard about it. Just wanted to comment that the digital download version is very easy to redeem on the Sony Marketplace. The download might take awhile with some dsl connections, but it was fast on cable internet. Also keep in mind you will not be able to resell a download and this is a single player game. In my opinion it is worth keeping anyways though.
