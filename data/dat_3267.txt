This game is still in Early Access, so it makes sense that some of the features aren't quite polished. However, for an Early Access game, it's very good. You're definitely not buying an unfinished product. The game is very in-depth and (at least for me) has a challenging aspect to it. Some things that need to be worked on, however, is the AI trading system, modifying the rules to match up with actual NHL rules, etc. http://www.ehmtheblueline.com/forums/portal.php is a great resource for anyone who needs help getting started.
