Hello Folks,<br /><br />There are twenty-five Skirmish (can Cooperative play these) and 50 Multiplayer maps! These maps can be huge & take 1/2 hour+ to complete each one. You'll need practice on the game mechanics & user interface before enjoying the game.<br /><br />Wonderful graphics and sound effects. Very nice map scenery. Developers try to model close to \\"reality\\", but also cut-in some game play-ability realities. Begin with Company of Heroes and graduate to playing this game; it is much more \\"realistic\\". And, the attention to detail is a nice touch. For instance, your flamethrower burns out the enemy in a house, the nearby trees catch on fire,and, as the house burns down,you get neat window glass breaking sounds throughout the house...Form and separate units at will: You can have any type of units in same squad, then disband them and reform another infantry group.<br /><br />No, you don't get a paratrooper squad where you can hit a fire-up button which makes them Supermen. Machine gun fire doesn't suppress, it will kill your men quickly. It doesn't take eight squads of engineers to kill one infantry man in a squad; snipers can't stand in front of a MG Bunker and not get killed; there is no population cap, no base building, and therefore, no base rushing. Blob attacks will get you decimated. There is no cute button you can hit and all of your units magically retreat in a hurry. No \\"millimeter health left\\" on a tank, that is also magically healing itself, as it retreats. And so on...<br /><br />Annoying: Overview map - INF are dots, Vehicles are arrows: \\"Where the heck are my Engineers? Oh crap, where is the guy with the toolbox?\\" Micromanaging units can be over-the-top when your numbers grow large in battles. Also, not too many in the MP arena; I would guess around 1/3-1/10 as many as you would see on COH. Perhaps a naive impression: MP'ers seem MUCH more talented than what you see on COHville.<br /><br />But, aside from the underwhelming overview map, the userinterface is, IMHO, much better than COH.<br /><br />Charming: US Accents at times sound like a German Gestapo agent barking orders/pleasant comments.<br /><br />May 6, 2012 Update: I have found that folks join games I form within minutes of me posting them. I find that the MP community is more mature and helpful both in and out of game. I am comparing the maturity to other games, such as COH, which I have played since 2005. No longer...<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br />Marc
