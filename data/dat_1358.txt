Battlefield 4 is great game in general BF3 veterans will be confused at first with the new controls but once you and some friends learn the way things work you'll soon rack up tons of xp and kills. Be warned though occasional freezing happens if you're not on next Gen consoles . All in all great multi player experience campaign could have been ALOT better wasn't worth the Time unless you want the 5+ guns for multi player.
