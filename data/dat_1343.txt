It's just like the first Borderlands, except with slightly different classes, more guns, and more enemies. The amount of replayability is really up to the individual gamer - if you're the kind who likes going through increasing difficulty levels of the same content and picking up more and better gear, then you'll probably get hundreds of hours of gameplay, especially if you go through the different classes.<br /><br />However, if one playthrough is enough and you never go back to do it all again with a different character, the you'll probably still get a good 20+ hours of quirky FPS fun out of it.
