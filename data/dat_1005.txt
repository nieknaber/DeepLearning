Fantastic game that rebels against the modern game industry by not holding the player's hand, and using difficulty in an interesting and challenging way.<br /><br />Has flaws (from the port), but they can easily be overlooked as Dark Souls is one of the best games of the last years.<br /><br />A must for any enthusiast.
