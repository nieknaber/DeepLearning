We bought the version for PC download. It took an insanely long time to download. We started in the evening and had to leave the computer on overnight to complete the download. Once that was finished, the game would not work. Neither 2K nor Steam (the platform you are forced to install along with the game in order to use it) have any way to contact a human being to resolve any issues; instead, they have an &#34;online community&#34; -- that means, you have to spend hours searching to maybe get an answer to your question -- and an email address. We sent an email and, 24 hours later, got an automated response saying our inquiry was in the queue.<br /><br />We phoned Amazon and they very nicely allowed us to exchange this download for a different download code that came on a physical card. (We had wanted to get a CD or DVD of the game, but it appears they don't make them anymore.) We installed this new download on a newer computer that runs Windows 8 (although according to the game specifications, it should have run on the previous computer which had Windows 7). Again, we left the computer on all night to download the game. Now it seems to be working (we haven't had a chance to actually play it yet) -- but only after literally three days of frustration.<br /><br />By the way, we still have not heard from 2K or Steam customer support as of the time this review is being written (2 days after our initial inquiry).
