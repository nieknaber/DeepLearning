The game was fun for about 10 hours then it hit a wall.<br /><br />I played WoW intensely for years so I've already grinded quest and such.  It gets old trying a new game w/ such concepts.  These quest are very detailed and small minute details matter=time sink.  Too me, it gets old now.  GW 2 was more a relaxed questing style that kept my attention longer.  Not bad for the price though....Thankfully I only paid $7.
