I love this creepy game,but was not aware that it wouldn't run under 8. But it runs on my Vista computer just fine. I'm kind of disappointed because I envisioned many hours out in the dark on my back porch,being creeped-out.<br />This is one of the scariest games I have ever played,the other being &#34;The Undying.&#34;<br />So...I will continue to play this on my desktop,enjoying it and wishing it ran 8.
