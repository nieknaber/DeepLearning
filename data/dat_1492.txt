I have been play games since I was a kid and Tomb Raider was on of the first female heroine 3d games I had played when it first came out in the mid 90's. I purchased this reboot version for the ps3 when it first released and must say it is fantastic. Several of the series release prior to this version we starting to drag the series down a bit and I am really glad that they made this and brought back things I loved about the original series.<br /><br />I just repurchased this game again, but for the PC as it was on sale and looking forward to seeing all the enhancements compared to it's console counterparts. Definitely worth a purchase for all gamers.
