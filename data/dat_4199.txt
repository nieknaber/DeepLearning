I enjoyed the game quite a bit, and it has tons of stuff to do!<br />There's tons and tons of side quests and the DLC was quite good!<br />Although after a certain point, you become too overpowered and makes it kind of pointless. It is repeditive too, almost feels like an MMO that isn't online. I mostly enjoyed it and the leveling system is pretty interesting. Definitely worth checking out if it's on sale!
