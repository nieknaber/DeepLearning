This game completely blew my mind. If you're looking for a game with a story that will leave you saying &#34;What just happened?&#34; this is your game. To controlling the characters is a bit clunky, but you get used to it. During action sequences (Which are really cool) the game turns into a big quicktime event. Defiantly not Call of Duty by any standard, the game is most comparable to Heavy Rain. Some characters are not really developed enough, and sometimes the storyline is a bit ridiculous. But fear not, I downloaded this for $5, and it was totally worth it. There are a lot of extras, such as the game's soundtrack, concept art, and making of videos. All the action sequences are replayable through the extras menu also. All in all, if you are bored with the same linear storyline that makes way too much sense, pick this up! Its interesting storyline really makes this game stand out, at least to me. 9.75/10<br />-Jerry
