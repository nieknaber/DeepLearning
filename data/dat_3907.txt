While fun, this iteration of [[ASIN:B004Q3RU0K You Don't Know Jack]] falls short of greatness. Headed by the cynical commentary of Cookie Masterson, this game disguises its trivia in pop culture references and sharp humor.  While great at providing a good laugh, the PC version of this game does not have any sort of multiplayer element.  I recommend getting the [[ASIN:B00498PSZQ Xbox 360 version]] as playing online with friends will be sure to bring many a laugh.
