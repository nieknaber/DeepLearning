This game was a delight to play with all the beautiful illustration, so much that I will play it again and again. I love the  British accent, which was very easy to understand. What I don't understand is the low review from the other reviewer. This is one of the best games that I have played, with very unique mini puzzles awesome story line. To be honest this game made me want to jump into my computer and be a part of the game so much do to the detailed BEAUTIFUL!!! illustration and with the ancient celtic style back ground music was an added plus. You will not go wrong purchasing this game if I could I would give this game a 10+ star. I hope to see a Margrave sequel.
