I bought 2 piece for me and my son and nothing is working fine. If you play online against each other you see 2 total different games!!! I've never seen such crap! One sees a crash - the other no crash! This happens all the time! Or you crash into no 18, but the others see you crashing into no 88 or similar. Additionally noone is playing online. You're along 99% of the time. No nice replay - like Nascar 2004 or so. Beware of this game.<br />Update Juni 2015: even though the told not to release a 2015 version - they did. Means our 2014 version after just 2 month turned into a piece of junk and nobody will play it online again. 2x 40$ for just nothing. Very bad experience.
