This is the first expansion pack for the Sims 3 that I have purchased. Before I downloaded this, my game would sometimes run a little slow. Usually it was during loading and not so much during the gameplay itself, so it wasn't too big of an issue. I had read in other reviews that the Sims 3 ran a little slow on laptops, so I just chalked it up to this being the case. However, now that I have installed Late Night, it seems to run a lot slower during the gameplay, and it seems a little buggy sometimes. It's still a lot of fun, and has lots of cool add ons and features, but I only gave it 3 stars because it's made my game run slower.
