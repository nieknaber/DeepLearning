PS Plus is hands down the best deal in gaming. PS4 now requires a Plus membership to play games online however, Plus gives out at least 2 free games per month ranging from indie titles to full games like Sleeping Dogs, Devil May Cry and Bioshock Infinite. The best part (for someone who owns all three) is that the membership carries over from PS3 to PS4 to PS Vita so you don't need to shell out $50 per system.<br /><br />I've heard that Xbox Live has recently started putting out free games twice a month but honestly, PS Plus makes a mockery out of their service. PS Plus offers a great selection of Indies as well as full retail games digitally that are more on the recent side of the timeline where as the majority of the games Xbox Live offers for free are 4 and 5 years old.<br /><br />Lastly, PS Plus offers you significant discounts (between 10-75%) on new and on sale items. Normally if a game is on sale for around $30 on the regular store PS Plus will offer it for anywhere from $15 to $20. Games that have just come out normally get a slight 10% discount which isn't much but it's still a discount on a new product which is awesome.<br /><br />To sum it up, PS Plus offers you free and reduced price games digitally for $50 a year.
