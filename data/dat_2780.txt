To counter the other reviewer who doesn't investigate (at all) before making a purchase apparently, this is a different, spin-off like game for the franchise. The game is great and very much more of the same from the original - excellent platforming, isometric action shooter with clever fun puzzles.    Don't listen to me or the first reviewer, just look at a review aggregation:  http://www.metacritic.com/game/playstation-4/lara-croft-and-the-temple-of-osiris
