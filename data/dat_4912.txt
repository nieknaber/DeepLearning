I already beat the game! YES! It's true, I beat it, hit it, kicked it! Luckily i bought the Limited Edition as Download on Amazon Germany. Only if you have the limited Edition you get the real limited experience that EA put in words on the cover of the game.<br /><br />Here is what you get with the limited Edition:<br /><br /> - Limited Gameplay, if not to say, VERY limited GamePlay<br /> - Limited value! You are basically buying a screensaver at the price of 60 USD.<br /> - Limited Fun! You can install the game, adjust the settings to 2580x resolution, if you use Bootcamp on an iMac like i do.<br /> - Limited sound! You get to hear a few composed tunes, amazing! Well, on itunes you pay 99 cents per song, so...<br /><br />So much for the limited Edition. Oh yeah, if you bought the DVD version of the game you also get incredible, additional extras:<br /><br /> - a DVD case, if you ever need to have that extra empty case to put your last blank DVD in, here you have it!<br /> - A gorgeously created cover, with the big letters of SimCity and EA on it. That alone should assure you unlimited future value, sell it on eBay in 10 years and you will get rich. After all you are in possession of the worst game in PC history!<br /><br />Oh yeah, EA forces you to be online to play the game at all times! Unfortunately, EA is mainly offline.<br />Latest rumors say that EA is no longer able to pay the steep price to fund their servers. So, all are forced to be online, with the exception of EA themselves.<br /><br />EA! - welcome to the Future of PC Gaming! Robbing people has never been this easy!<br />BR from Europe, Holger van de Linde
