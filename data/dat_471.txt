Be prepared to take A LOT of notes.  Got into this game for several days on end but had to walk away from of it for about a week.  Not the kind of game that I would want to put down and then expect to remember where I left off.  Very challenging.  Ended up getting stuck, and totally out of time to devote to it so I used some cheats from the net.  Over and over again I kicked myself for not catching this clue or that clue.  Will probably buy the next installment from the Adventure Company as I enjoyed Safe Cracker also, but this is not the kind of game for \\"mindless\\" fun. LOVED the atmosphere.....almost gave me nightmares!
