The first time I played New Vegas through it was before most of the DLC was available, and I am glad that I decided to do this all over again.  Old World Blues, although slightly repetitive with the same enemies over and over (as is common with most DLC), is a lot of open.  It times parts of other DLC's into it without giving anything away, is open ended, and subjects you to some challenging quests.  Definitely worth the $5, and you can go back after beating it, allowing you to complete what you may have missed when going through it originally.
