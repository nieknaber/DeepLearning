This is one of those titles that you really need to see in action to get; think Bomberman with teeth instead of bombs and bump up the pace to a frenzy.<br /><br />Each player (up to 4) assumes control of a colored critter that is locked to a different colored critter controlled by the AI or another player. You can only go after that critter and the targets quickly change. To keep things interesting, there are various power-ups that drop and an arcade mode that you and another player can take on cooperatively. When they say arcade they're not kidding either because if you lose a round, you start over from the beginning. I played with an XBox 360 controller, so I can't vouch for how a mouse/keyboard combo handles, but overall the controls are simple and don't get in the way.<br /><br />The good: Fast paced, local coop, varied levels and easy controls (didn't try PC mouse/keyboard).<br /><br />The bad: For me, I lost track of who I was supposed to be going after on numerous occasions and got taken out. This happened frequently and I blame a combination of poor attention span and the frequent changing of targets (shown as a colored disc at your feet that matches your target).<br /><br />Worth noting: Local play only from what I understand, although I admit I wasn't interested in online play and didn't look for it.<br /><br />All in all it's well worth the $6 for a quick game here and there with friends/family.
