This game with the graphics on ultra and sound on war tapes and some x41 turtle beaches is insane, had shell shock a lot in 64 player maps! just wanted to hide get some kills and hiding just got me killed..lol<br /><br />but Field of View in video settings is at 70 and for me to have some situational awareness in needed it at 90 to see more of the area around me!!
