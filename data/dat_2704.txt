I was looking for an untimed, basic match 3 game and this fit the bill.  This game also has a timed version for those who prefer that.  Power up features have always frustrated and baffled me, but in this game it was easy to pick it up and use them, although I still prefer to only use them when stuck. The inclusion of simple jigsaw puzzles was a bonus as I really enjoy them.  Unlike the other reviewers I had no problems viewing the gallery of completed pups.  Now for the cons:  After several pups, the story line stopped functioning.  This didn't bother me too much as that is the least important aspect to me but it would be nice to be able to read it once.  Worse yet, I was unable to complete the game as it freezes up on level 191 which for me was the last pup.  It comes up with a blank box and all boosters closed.  It's a swap mode but there's nothing to swap.  When I restart  it, it flashes &#34;no more moves&#34; but doesn't reload.  I created a new player and started over.  Once again, it skipped the story line and when I was on the last pup and came to level 191, the playing board again did not load but was a solid white grid.  I still enjoy it, but even if a cheap price for entertainment, I expect to get what I paid for.  Very disappointed.
