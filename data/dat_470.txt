So far out of the 60 digital games I own this one is the underrated best. The graphics are awesome and the shooting, whip, and environmental mechanics are big fun. Got to admit I also like the voice overs. I thought Bulletstorm would just be crude juvenile humor but I'm impressed with it, you actually want to see what happens next.
