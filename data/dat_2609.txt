I paid more than the current listed price and feel it was not really worth the coin.<br /><br />I know that this series has been around for a while and I do not wish to treat upon<br />fans of the title. I have never played any Might and Magic games until this one.<br />So, the following are simply MY opinions . . .<br /><br />The main issue I had was that the very first campaign (past the tutorial) becomes<br />difficult if not impossible to complete about half way through.<br />There is a boss (and his army) held up in a castle that is rediculously more difficult<br />than all prior foes. I even tried to not &#34;trigger him&#34; and build up my forces and still<br />had a heck of a time against him etc.<br /><br />After some research and learning some behind the scenes drama as it were, I concluded<br />(at least in my opinion) that the game has some programming flaws; or at least bad<br />judgement in creating the engine in certian areas etc; to make matters worse is that the<br />original team has a conflict with Ubisoft wich forced them to rush the programming AND<br />these difficulties may never be corrected etc etc (so it is my understanding in paraphrase)<br /><br />If the game did not have the problems I just discussed I would state that the game is fun<br />BUT far too simplistic. The batles have a tactic format BUT have few stratigic options in reality.<br />The customizaton of your heroes is a little dull and the build up of your towns is just a<br />matter of points with little personal customization. But that is just my opinion.<br /><br />With the exception of the apparent programming flaw I would recommend this to fans of the series.<br /><br />I became so frustrated with this game that I simply stopped trying etc . . .shame<br /><br />Download and install: No problems to speak of
