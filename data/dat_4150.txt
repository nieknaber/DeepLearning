I finally found a program to print my envelopes.  The Envelope Printer Lite (Download) was easy and fast to download and was printing my envelopes in just a few minutes.  Thank you Amazon for providing this program and for providing it for free. It prints the mail-to address a little lower on the envelope than I normally do, but I was so happy to be able to print them.  Nothing else prints envelopes anymore, at least not that I could find. It doesn't save, each address must be re-entered each time.  Easier to do than hand writing and looks much more professional. I am very happy to have found this.
