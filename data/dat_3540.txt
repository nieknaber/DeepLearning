There is a lot of variety in the race tracks<br />The gameplay is solid and the soundtrack is awesome<br />No dud items, all items are useful<br />This game is a lot of fun. Buy it<br /><br />Although:<br />This game is all about boosting. You will constantly be aiming for boost pads and building up a boost meter by drifting & doing stunts. I recommend watching a gameplay video to see if it's for you as it is not a standard racing title.
