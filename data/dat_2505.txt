Will keep this brief. This is easily the BEST playstation network game that is out. I bought this the day it came out and have probably put over 200 hours into it and counting. It is so much fun to play. It is mainly played online so if you do like to play online it might not be for you. Anyone who does like online games will love this. You have a jetpack and weapons and you fly around killing dudes in a TDM or DM mode and there is also a tactical mode call \\"map objective\\" which is my personal favorite where the objective is to blow up a base or capture data. It has a capture the flag type of feel to it and when you have a game with the max amount of players(12) it's an absolute blast! I have bought many psn games but never have I played or enjoyed one as much as I do Crash Commando!
