I've been playing BF since the first game and I would have to say this is the easiest to get into but hardest to master. Lots of optional weapons and unlocks. The graphics are spectacular when powered by a good graphics card. Sure there are some growing pains, however good things come to those who wait! I recommend for people who like combined arms warfare and a fast dynamic gameplay style.
