While it still has a few bugs, mainly in the online play, this feels like a big step up from 2k14.  Best basketball game since NBA 2k5. Highly recommend to anyone holding out.<br /><br />I play it on my TV using steam big picture mode and it works great.  You will need a decent GPU and adequate RAM to reach the full potential of this game.  I started out using an outdated EVGA GTX280 and 6GB RAM.  The game ran good on Medium settings, but some of the hair and other small details looked weird.  Now I have a OC'd MSI R7 260x and 12 GB RAM.  I run all the settings at high/ultra and the game looks and plays amazing.  I played it on my friends XBOne and prefer the look and feel of the PC version over the console.<br /><br />Cons:<br />Online play is laggy more often than not.  Sometimes the lag is small, other times, it kicks everyone out of the game and screws you out of the points you earned.  Very frustrating to say the least.<br /><br />The point system on the My Team mode is horrible.  The only way to score an adequate amount of points is by taking advantage of a fast break glitch, which takes all the fun out of the game.<br /><br />You can't use some of the historic players out of the box.  The only way to unlock them is through the My Team mode, which sucks.  Unlocking some of the legends is far too difficult and time consuming.  I wanted to start a Franchise with Bob Cousy, but I can't, because he's not unlocked.  I started to attempt to unlock him, but eventually gave up.  Now I mainly play My Player mode, which is great.<br /><br />The music sucks and you can't import your own music into the game. There's a few decent songs, but after hearing them 100's of times, I ended up turning all the music off.
