this is not the bundle that you are looking for. it contains steam keys for 4 of the 5 listed games, but does not contain a steam key for condemned: criminal origins.<br /><br />as of 30 august 2013, amazon digital services is selling another bundle with the same name, the same 5 games, for the same discounted price, which DOES contain 5 steam keys (including a steam key for condemned: criminal origins). you can find it at [[ASIN:B00AEV8ITK Sega Action only pack [Download]]].<br /><br />i'm not sure why this bundle has been discounted again & put back into the \\"deals\\" section for the same price as that other bundle, since that one seems to be designed to replace this one. they're almost completely identical to each other, except for that one particular detail. i can only surmise that amazon made a mistake while selecting & pricing the downloads for the \\"late summer discount sale.\\"
