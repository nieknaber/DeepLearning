I wanted some of the new scenarios, maps, and units I had read about after playing Civ V for about a year. While this add-on does slow down game play a bit on my 2-year-old MacBook Pro, the enhancements are well worth it.<br /><br />I am still learning about the new Faith strand of play, and haven't really even begun to explore the Espionage parts. I'm still enjoying the new units, maps, civs, and tweaks. I have 90-plus hours on the original game, and already have about six hours racked up on this expansion. If you like Civ V, you'll love Gods & Kings.
