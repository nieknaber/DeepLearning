For me, this is easily a 5-star game. The game was original and had smooth, enjoyable gameplay. There wasn't much about this game that I disliked, aside from a bit of repetition in the missions later in progression, which isn't that big of a deal, since this game did a great job at maintaining decent mission variety.. I would recommend this to essentially anyone who enjoys strategy games, distinctive gameplay, futuristic or sci-fi themes, the list goes on and on . I find it hard to believe that any true gamer would immediately turn their noses up at this without a second thought, as there is very little to complain about.<br />Overall, a highly entertaining game that I certainly see myself replaying in the future. Buy it! You won't be disappointed!
