I took a chance on this game since it went on sale.  Boy I wasn't dissapointed at all.  In fact I got The Conquerors and The Forgotten (The Forgotten is a new release with new objectives and civilizations, it will need to be purchased through Steam and it will merge into the AOEII HD version).<br /><br />Like other reviews state you WILL HAVE to have Steam to play the game.  It's no big deal just download Steam on the system then redeem your code.  It will download and you will be able to play it.<br /><br />Graphics are way better now than the disc version.
