There is a reason Pandemic studios was shut down. This game has some major problems.  Controller is buggie and wont work.  Many of the controls in the options cant be changed b/c they are not even listed.  Gameplay is boring, and sluggish. To climb you have to spam the spacebar, compared to assassin creed climbing is a chore. Feels like an unfinished game.  I only spent $8 dollars and that was too much!
