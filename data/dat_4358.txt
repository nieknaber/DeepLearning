This game was a terrible let down. I purchased a copy for myself and my wife and we were both terribly disappointed.<br /><br />It really does very little to connect itself with previous elder scrolls titles. The graphics are sub par even on an i7 & Nvidia 765 graphics card. The dialog is watered down after the introduction and voices from actors do not sync with lip movements.<br /><br />You receive 1 gold regardless of the difficulty of mobs killed. Players camp quest npcs and shared loot is non existent. Guilds will horde exclusive mobs like werewolves or vampires that provide the diseases to turn in to them. Bots are rampant and the trade and general windows are filled with spam for in game currency.<br /><br />Combat is clunky and feels like you are hitting enemies with a wet noodle. Animations are poorly implemented in both first & third person (third is worse!). Lots of travel required but mounts are ridiculously expensive. I don't mind this considering I have been playing wow since vanilla and mounts were just as expensive back then but the loot rate seriously hampers this and quests & crafting do not provide enough to realize the long term investments in obtaining a mount.<br /><br />The game is also a pay to play subscription model and has been pushed back numerous times for a console release. I realize zenimax is not the same company that designed previous elder scrolls but has the bar really been lowered this much to where we are giving our hard earned money to companies who consistently cut corners when designing games and bank of the history and name of a well known title?<br /><br />I feel sorry for anyone who does enjoy this crashy buggy mess that will eventually hit free to play. I played the beta and the game didn't feel any different from the beta than it did at release. There are much more fun games available at a significantly less premium that require less time and energy invested to enjoy yourself and access content that should be available to any player.any player.
