Others have said that you can't use an Amazon gift card to pay for this...THEY'RE WRONG!    It is a little confusing, but if you redeem the gift card first and then purchase the MS points it'll ask for a credit card. Once you put in the credit card info it'll automatically pay for the MS points using the gift card credit. The code appears and it works.    Totally buying again!
