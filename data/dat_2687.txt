Finally broke down and bought this. Great decision. The instant game collection has totally opened my eyes to games I would likely never go out and purchase and not just the amazing free ones but the + prices for the ones you pay for. My budget is tight right now so being able to get new GOOD games (some great wink wink BIOSHOCK Infinite) that I can just download and play helps me significantly.<br /><br />Very pleased I did this.
