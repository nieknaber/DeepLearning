ENCHANTED ISLAND IS A VERY GOOD GAME. I HAVEN'T PLAYED ALL OF THE LEVELS AND THERE ARE A LOT OF VARIATIONS TO  PLAY AT EACH LEVEL. EVEN THOUGH IT IS TAKING ME A LONG TIME TO GET THROUGH THE GAME, I DON'T GET BORED GETTING THROUGH THE LEVELS. IF YOU LIKE MAH JONG GAMES, YOU WILL LIKE THIS ONE. SO ORDER THIS GAME AND HAVE FUN!!!!
