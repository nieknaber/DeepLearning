This was the first time management game that I have played, and it was fun! The pace and features were great!<br /><br />At level 26 it got tricky...I couldn't complete the level before doing it a quite a number of times. I didn't have the money to buy the cart needed to be successful through it...which was my fault I am sure.<br /><br />It took me several weeks to finish this game, which I loved! There are five hotels to remodel and service. I am going to look for more like this one. I think you will enjoy the experiences of this time management game.<br /><br />The only thing I didn't like is when you are not successful on a level you have to buy all the stars and items all over again, each time. If it takes several tries to complete a level, you are buying the items repeatedly because your money refills and your items go away to what it was before you chose your items in the beginning of that level - too time consuming, in my opinion.
