You don't buy this for the multiplayer maps. As a matter of fact, black ops 2 multiplayer just sucks in general, but I'm sure if you own the game then you know that already. However, the zombies maps are what makes this worth getting. If you aren't a zombies fan, then don't bother. But, if you liked Black Ops or WaW zombies, then you will love this. Don't let tranzit set the bar for you. These maps go above and beyond in terms of intricacy, weapon choice, and just straight up fun. This will keep you playing for hours. If you don't believe me, I would recommend watching some youtube videos. The four DLC maps are &#34;Die Rise&#34;, &#34;Mob of the Dead&#34;, &#34;Buried&#34;, and &#34;Origins&#34;. Trust, me this is worth your money.
