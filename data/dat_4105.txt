The main problem with this package is that the value of your dollar versus buying gold directly from Wargaming is less.<br /><br />If you buy this package, you'll essentially be buying 3675 gold. At the rate of $20, you're buying 183.75 gold per $1.<br /><br />If you buy the $14.95 gold package off of the in-game store, you're getting 200.67 gold per $1.<br /><br />The next package up is an even better deal (you understand the trend now) at 217 gold per $1.<br /><br />SO what's the merit in this package?<br /><br />Well, if you have Amazon gift cards with nothing you can possibly think of buying other than WoT gold, then it's a solid package. Unfortunately however, its use to a new player is very limited, as this tank is not a stellar performer that will make your experience easy. If you're new to the game, you should be starting out as all do: with a new account at the first tier.<br /><br />For the experienced players, you're likely looking to buy for the hope of better gold values. You simply won't find it in this package at this price point.<br /><br />Your only value out of this tank is to buy it for the crew training benefits that it offers. However, you may find this 'value' rather reduced, as the tank is not the greatest performer with it's gun in the tier matches you find yourself in. An M4 Sherman would be a better bet.<br /><br />I hope this helps anyone looking to buy this for their initial experience, but the main purpose was to assist those that were, like me, looking to buy it in hopes of using a gift card/ getting a deal on WoT gold. Look to this package if it hits $15 for the expert pack, but otherwise, you should pass.
