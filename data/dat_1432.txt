It's a fun asteroids-ish game. Too bad the sound doesn't function. I've read that there is a more recent patch for the game, but amazon doesn't have it available. And the other site that sells it, requires that you have purchased it from them to get the patch.<br /><br />In short, I really enjoy the gameplay, but the lack of sound hurts the game.
