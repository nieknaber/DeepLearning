This should have been my first option but i went with gamestop and ordered it online, what a mistake that was. The online receipt said they would not charge me until the item has shipped but seeing as this was a online download code i don't see how that would be possible. Anyway, they charged me right away and i get an email saying they CANCELED MY ORDER! Take my money than cancel my order? bulls***. I called and could barley understand the customer service rep. but she did say my money would be reimbursed in 24 hours. AMAZON is the way to go. just a few clicks and credit card info, and they INSTANTLY give you the code.
