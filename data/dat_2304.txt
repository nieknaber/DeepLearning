I believe the previous reviewer was a little too negative in his review.  Your opinion of this game will depend on what you are looking for.  I just wanted a mahjong game.  I was not looking for adventure mode or the other stuff.  I wanted clear tiles i could read, the traditional game and nothing else.  I play the game for its puzzle value.  So this game worked for me.
