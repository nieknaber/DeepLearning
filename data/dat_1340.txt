It's a BioWare game, so you know it's going to be good. Solid gameplay, a largely intuitive combat system, compelling characters and romances, and the depth of worldbuilding rank this highly among PC RPGs, and its real-time-with-pause combat, reminiscent of Knights of the Old Republic and (to a lesser extent) the Mass Effect series, allows for a strong balance of action and tactics. Highly recommended for anyone who enjoyed other BioWare games or just appreciates a good RPG.
