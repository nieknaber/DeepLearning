As you can see from the comments, this game is polarizing.  People either love it or hate it.  Here are my cons and pros.  (Cons first since you'll likely make your decision based on those).<br /><br />Cons<br />Bugs.  There are some annoying bugs.  I've played from launch and never experienced a game-ending bug (e.g. getting dropped to the desktop, or worse).  I have had to log out and log back in.  Does that break the mood?  Of course, but it hasn't been horrible.<br /><br />Weird combo of MMO and solo play.  Some quests can only be done solo.  If you try to do them in a group you will end up in separate instances.  I guess that is a game design choice - your character is supposed to be special, you must do some things alone.  It is a somewhat odd decision and makes things hard if you are planning on playing with a spouse or friend.<br /><br />Bag space.  There is no limit on the number of skills your character can train.  But, bag space is ridiculously low and very expensive to increase.  So, while you run around you may find resource nodes but may elect to not pick them up because of lack of space.  This situation is exacerbated by having a shared bank account across all your characters.  It sounds like a great idea -- any character can access anything in the bank at any time; the result however is chronic lack of space.<br /><br />Bots.  There are a lot of bots and gold sellers.  The company is working on that and the number has gone down but they are still an annoyance.<br /><br />Add ons.  The game is simply not as much fun if you play it without add ons.  The interface is extremely sparse and it is hard to keep track of things.  If you want everything in one place (which seems reasonable) you will be disappointed.<br /><br />Research.  As with add ons, you will need to do some research outside of the game in wikis and such to get the most out of it.  Otherwise you could easily miss important places and things.<br /><br />The last two cons depend on your expectations for the game.  Some people like tinkering, others want everything in one place.<br /><br />Pros<br /><br />Amazing graphics and atmosphere sounds.  It is really a beautiful world.  I tend to not ride my horse, I walk around just to see all the interesting details.<br /><br />Great quests.  I'm surprised about the other comments I've seen here.  I don't think a quest has ever asked me to kill 10 such and suchs.  Quests are things like, work your way through a trap ridden dungeon to recover an item (common enough), but take the ship's monkey with you and throw dates onto the trap mechanisms -- the monkey is too light to set off the trap, but when he grabs the date he will reset it.  A nice little touch that makes the quest more fun.<br /><br />Massive content.  If you want to take a game slow and enjoy seeing all the little touches this is the game for you.ctations for the game.
