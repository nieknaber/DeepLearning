For the ones having a issue redeeming codes, first before you come on here and give it a bad rating maybe you should try other methods, For PS3 users do not go to PlayStation store to redeem it but instead go to account management and press X then scroll down to redeem codes then put your code in and poof done. easier then i don't no coming on here ranting and raving how it doesn't work and giving it a bad rating, use that time and effort into problem solving.
