Let me begin by saying that this game is epic and fun. If you enjoy science fiction movies/shows such as Blade Runner, Star Wars, Farscape and such you will absolutely love this game. Unfortunately, one of the .rar archive files included in the installation folder is damaged (mapsNOR.rar), I attempted to re-download from Amazon; alas, the two broken files within the archive were still broken. I had to delete the files inside Winrar and upload some working files into the archive that I had gotten from a friend who has mass effect installed on his computer. Looking around the internet, it seems people have had this problem since no later than 2008, which I believe is completely unforgivable that Electronic Arts/Bioware has not repacked mapsNOR.rar since it was discovered in 2008 in order to fix the problem. It literally only took me less than 5 minutes to fix the archive once I had the two working files. Shame on you Electronic Arts/Bioware!<br /><br />UPDATE: Mass Effect 2 also had a similar problem with the english.rar installation file and needed to be fixed, that's officially 0 for 2 on installation, but still a fantastic gaming experience once you manage to install it.
