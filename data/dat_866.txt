I enjoyed playing this game in the relaxed mode, as I tend to panic in timed mode on puzzle-type games when I can't place the pieces where they belong fast enough to beat the clock.  This game has many more levels than I expected, so it kept me occupied playing it for several days before I completed the entire map.  I think anyone who enjoys jigsaw puzzles will enjoy this game as well.
