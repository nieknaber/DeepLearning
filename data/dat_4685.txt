You have to have a membership to xbox live to use the xbox on the internet...WTF???? that's like microsoft charging you a monthly fee to access the internet with your computer... save yourself some money and lots of frustration, just buy a playstation.  My old playstation 2 still works fine but I have bought 3 xboxes in 3 years!
