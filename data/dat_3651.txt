In order to be able to play this game you need to install a software called Origin as well. By doing so you will have to accept license terms which allow EA, the publisher of the game, to scan your pc in oh so many ways, then transfer, save and process the data in certain ways.  Did anybody say \\"spyware\\"? Did I hear \\"trojan horse\\"?  Me? I'm saying \\"bye EA\\". Luckily, there are other companies who make great products!
