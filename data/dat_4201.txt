I have found that games that require inventories, moving back and forward between scenes, and piecing clues together requires more thought than I am willing to put in. At this point in my life, when I sit down to play a game, I just want to relax, not extend what I have been doing all day. I am sure it is a good game to play, but right now I am taxed enough. I do not mid using some brain power, but the instructions are not that clear and I do not want to use my time trying to figure it out.
