As a long time pre-Sims Maxis supporter, I was hoping that SimCity would be a return to form. Alas, the directive that Electronic Arts has passed down to its developers to play up the social aspect of gaming has harmed this release. Forcing the players to connect to servers to play what, traditionally, was a single player sandbox city building game, is a turn for the worse.<br /><br />Let's not even get started on the Always On DRM and server load issues.. Overall, this game launch was a debacle.
