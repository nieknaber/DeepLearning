I attempted to download this game from Amazon.com to run on our BRAND NEW (Dec 2010) Dell Windows 7 machine.  The download occurred, but the install failed.  I was disappointed in the Ubisoft support I received to fix this problem.  They told me I had to work with tech support from my purchaser.  Amazon provided great customer service in that they were easy to reach, and quickly provided me a refund, but they couldn't solve the issue.  So, we never got the download version to install properly.  I had the same problem with HAWX2, by the way.    We subsequently bought the HAWX software from a store.  It installed without any issue from the provided discs.  The game itself is excellent.    If you are interested in buying this game, I would say to go ahead and try to download it from Amazon.  If it works, GREAT!  If not, Amazon will give your money back, and then you can try to buy the CD-version.
