The best video game Ive made in years. This trilogy bought on the recommendation of a friend when I needed a good game brought me bac to pc gaming and rekindled my love for RPGs. Everything about the story, the characters, the settings, choices are increcible I would play through multiple times if it was just text based. But then there are the graphics that made everything feel alive, while the first one was a little stiff with movements and the colors dulled it was still good and by the 3rd one the graphics were good enough that I could believe everything I was looking at could be real. Madden is the standard for sports, Halo for shooters, Mass Effect should be the torch bearer for RPGs and PC gaming as a whole. It brought an athlete and sports game fan and him into a RPG fan.
