I love this game, its very old but as others will tell you the strategy and game script is great, you just have to read the controls in the PDFs manual.  DOES THIS DOWNLOAD WORK?  I had installed my friends disc before and had saved games already on my computer, when I was installing THIS download it ran it to some problems and I was unable to play the barbarian invasion.  YOU MUST make sure that you uninstall every bit of the game (except saves of course) before installing the amazon download. Also if you don't do this, in order to launch the game you need to open the files and find the silver square icon with a green play button called launch and click it multiple times  I've had this game for nearly a year now and it's still fun. Back when I bought it, it was only three dollars for the download though. Remember that if you buy the disc, you will need to put the disc in every time to play, with the download you can install it on ANY COMPUTER AND PLAY IT ANYWHERE. Which I love, so I can have it on my desktop and my laptop  plus since its older an older game it will most likely work on anything  In summary  Get the download, but first make sure to uninstall or delete all reminents of the game before hand, it works great for the PC download. Total war makes splendid games you just have to read/understand the controls and how to play (; hope this helped you.
