I purchased this on a lark... I'm not much of a video game player, but I figured it'd be nice to have something to do in my free time when the friends weren't available. It took what seemed like an eternity to install and, once it did, it wouldn't start properly. It still freezes every time I try to start the campaign and eventually closes itself. The only indication as to what is going on I get is a message that reads &#34;fatal error&#34;. I've tried updating the software, uninstalling the game and re-installing it... Everything under the sun. I payed over $20 for a game that doesn't even work... I'm pretty disappointed with this whole video game thing. Don't waste your time buying it...
