Thus game is very simular to Supreme Ruler 2020, because of this, fans who loved 2020 will enjoy Cold War and vice versa. The cool thing about this game is that it improves upon many of the past Supreme Rulers adding more content and things to do. The downside to this is that the game an a very steep learning curve and the HUD is less than friendly. I must applaud the sheer amount of things to do in this game though, including everything from taxes to building and military. You play as any country starting from 1949 to the end of the cold war. If you play as America for example, you may decide to declare war on Russia rather than making the Soviet Union fall. China may decare WW3 and Sweden may decide to go Communist. The possibilities are endless. For these reasons, I give this game a 4/5
