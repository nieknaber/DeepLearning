[[ASIN:B003JY78I6 Royal Envoy [Game Download]]]  This is a GREAT game!  I have now played it through to completion two times, and am thinking about starting it over again.  :-)  Unlike the previous reviewer who is not actually reviewing the GAME, but technical difficulties... I can say without doubt that this is one of my favorite \\"fit it in\\" games!  I love sitting down and playing a few chapters in the morning with a cup of coffee before the kids wake up.  ;)  I highly recommend this game with its great graphics and fun storyline.  I would also recommend you look for an online hints/walkthrough for the higher levels... just to give you an idea of what exactly you should be doing for the chapter, which is very helpful.  Overall, a big \\"thumbs up\\" from Playrix!<br /><br />P.S. Unlike the previous reviewer, I had no difficulties with Amazon downloading or playing this game on my laptop, which is running Vista.  Perhaps they got a bum download site??? as I know Amazon has several different download portals that the games come through on... I would suggest the previous reviewer contact Amazon Customer Service and see if they can redirect their download site or something... but again, I had no problems myself with this game download.  Happy Playing!  :)
