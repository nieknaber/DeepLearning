So you want to go back to Rift and try it again with this new \\"expansion\\".  Fine print you don't see is that NO GAME TIME is included if you reactivate your old account.  You get a game you can't use unless you immediately purchase game time.<br /><br />Such a ripoff - never heard of this marketing scam before.  Good Luck Trion.
