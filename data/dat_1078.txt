[UPDATE] Like I said in this review waiting for a new driving would be best.  A new patch has been issued and the AMD beta driver dated Nov. 16th (AMD CATALYST 12.11 BETA8 DRIVER) Improved the framerate significantly (I have AMD 6800s with option of crossfire and a 970 AMD Black edition CPU).  60 FPS with most settings maxed.  Patience, that is all that is require you whiny gamers!<br /><br />These guys giving MW a single star are ridiculous.  Instead of wasting your time reading the pathetic wimpering of owners 680 video cards who can't be bothered to temper their massive impatience until new drivers are released take a look at this light technical review of MW: Rage3D.com \\"Need for Speed: Most Wanted PC Technical Review\\"<br />This article gives you a very reasonable overview of the troubles this port is grappling with absent drivers that take advantage of the GPU. As it stands for the moment this game is CPU bound,.<br /><br />However, if you can put your anger aside unlike these frothing owners of PCs' intended to help them overcome the obvious limitations of their manhood you will find a real gem of a Need for Speed experience.  Just reduce your graphical settings so that you can improve the sub par framerate that dips far too often.  The most common setting that will improve your performance is the geometry setting.  This isn't the first you have had do this kind of thing but who cares if it makes you have a blast with this game.<br /><br />I am running an AMD quad core 970 with the option to invoke cross fire with my dual 6850s.  Crossife doesn't do anything at this point so don't worrry about it and just turn your settings down and run one card.  I fooled around with my settings switched my settings to medium.  This seemed to really help with the framerate<br /><br />So enjoy this game and just look forward to playing MW with whatever fixes come down the pike.
