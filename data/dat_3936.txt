Battlefield Bad company 2 was a good game, it could run on minimum settings on my 1.86 ghz processor computer, and had a pretty satisfying campaign. I really liked the destructible environment, but the voicing glitched on my computer, so I couldn't hear people talking in cutscenes, and noone plays multi player
