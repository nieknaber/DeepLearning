No support for 360 controller. There is a workaround, but this game is best played by keyboard and mouse. Even if you get the buttons mapped on the controller, there still isn't a soft lock aiming option. For the casual gamer who likes controllers, get Payday 2 as it does support controllers. Overall, the game isn't that bad. They could have made some of the earlier missions much easier and it seems like there is an endless supply of stupid cops that love to run blindly into a hostage situation. Not for those that expect a certain amount of realism from their games. It is a true arcade shooter.
