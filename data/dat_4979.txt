I got this for $ 1.25 as a download and even at this price this game is really bad , the biggest problem is you cant aim your guns , you could be right in front of an enemy with your gun pointed at their head and it will shoot over its shoulder. This alone makes this game worthless. on the rare occasion that you start to hit an enemy, it takes 10 shots to do anything to their 1 or 2 shots to take you out.Usually I would tell people if they can get this cheap to give it a go , but it is just plain boring and doesn't work.....avoid this one , I'm deleting it from my computer and i'll try pretty much anything
