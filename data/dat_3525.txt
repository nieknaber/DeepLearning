Love this game! Great mystery and not even to the end yet. I think its going to end soon, but go around the corner and there is a new adventure and more to solve. The game has been very long and well worth the price. I have not finished the game yet, but it is so good I had to write the review. Love the character Angelica Weaver great detective. There is not a lot of seek and find more mini games, and some of the mini games are harder then others, which makes them very challenging....get stuck...you can always use the skip option. In a nutshell this game is like a awesome mystery adventure book with a little bit of eeriness that you just cannot put down...I have to just keep playing, playing and playing....I will definitely be playing this one again....
