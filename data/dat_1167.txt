I've seen a few other reviews about how the purchase and install process went at Amazon so I thought I'd chime in with my own experience.  Frankly, it could not have been an easier transaction.  I purchased the game from Amazon and didn't even have to bother with their downloader.  I input the game key into Steam and it validated my purchase and I was able to download all the game files through the Steam Client.  Piece of cake.  DoW:2 does ask you to connect to Games for Windows Live to get achievements and play MP, but if you have an Xbox Live account, then you're already set.  Just login with those credentials.  Amazon provides a great deal, even better than Steam's regular price for this pack.    Oh and the game is fun too!  Nice take on the RTS genre.  As someone who doesn't particularly like micro-management with base building and resources, this is a fun twist in gameplay.  Warhammer Universe continues to be very entertaining.
