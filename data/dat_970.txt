Until this title is at least 60-75% do not purchase it, from day 1 the game has been a buggy glitched mess. Add to that the inneffective patching by developer DICE, and I have started to understand why lawsuits have arisen because of the game's state. In a word this game is a dumpster fire, the core mechanics are good, the map design better than BF3, but the product never performs up to snuff. Do not support the terrible business practices EA has employed with this game, instead spend your hard earned money on a feature complete game that works as intended.
