The best thing this game has going for it are its graphics.  They're, overall, crisply rendered and interesting.  As for the game play, it's extremely 'hand-holdie', meaning that you're mostly not given the opportunity to really figure anything out. Clues are constantly flashing to lead you directly to where an object is hidden, where you should angle the camera, etc.  Also, they're no consequences for using a hint (they're innumerable) or for letting the clock run. There's absolutely nothing at or to risk here.  I'd mostly recommend this to the very young, or to anyone who's interested in spending just under $7 to see if they can finish it in under 2 hours.  Trust me, it can be done.
