This game has a few bugs I've encounter but nothing that ruins it or makes it a pain to play. The amount of things to research, build, or upgrade is something I spend tons of tIme on because I love being able to micromanage them. If I get sick of that ( which I haven't in 20+  hrs of play) I get enjoy the awesome turn based combat which IMO they almost perfected. I never played the original, so I can't really compare them, but they definitely did an awesome job on this game (- the bugs which will be fixed in future updates). Really though, what game ever launches without some bugs though? Very few I'm aware of but like i said, they don't affect my enjoyment in this game one bit! What's all this beef about steam anyway? I used to not like it myself until bought my first game on it and realized what a blessing for me it was. If your anything like me, cd's/DVD's tend to get damaged or lost especially with kids and an OCD wife who loves to throw away things she thinks are trash. With steam, I don't have to worry about loosing any of the discs or the cd keys. I wrote this on a smoke break from xcom, sorry if it seems like I'm a 15 y/o but I'm in a hurry to get back to some new weapons I finally had the money to manufacture...
