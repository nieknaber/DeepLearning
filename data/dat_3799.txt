The system requirements for NBA 2k12 are ridiculously high. I have the newest Macbook Pro and run Windows on bootcamp. I checked the system requirements before buying and my computer exceeds the recommended requirements. However, whenever I play the game it is extremely laggy and choppy to the point where it is not fun. The only solution is to lower the graphics settings by a lot to eliminate the lag, however this means that the players and crowd look terrible. Gameplay is fun because I love basketball, however lag issue is really a dealbreaker for me.
