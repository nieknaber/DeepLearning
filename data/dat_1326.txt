If you were looking for a game like MAX PAYNE 1 or 2. Look elsewhere.<br /><br />30gig download.<br /><br />Cut-scenes every time you open a door.<br /><br />Unlikeable protagonist.<br /><br />Terrible mouse aiming.<br /><br />Placed Max Payne inside scenes from grand theft auto.<br /><br />Absolutely lackluster storytelling and no NOIR feeling to this game.
