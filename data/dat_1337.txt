I can't give this a zero rating, sadly. I would, because it fails at the most basic tenant of playing a game. Which part would that be? The play part. You see, once this beauty of a beast is placed onto your PC via Origin, you'll be lucky to even get it to open. Oh, the server issues are long gone I am sure. But I can't even get the damn game to pop-up.<br /><br />In that way, the game fails completely. And so does origin. I have updated Origin, I have asked for help. But EA seems very happy to just ignore the bugs in Origin and just be happy collecting the money that we hand over. I regret buying this game, it was a mistake. I honestly, honestly got bought in by the trailers. Had I waited just a week, I'd have known never to touch this vile excuse for a... well I can't call it a game since I can't play it.<br /><br />I suppose I should just call it 'boxart' - yes, I am very upset that I paid 60$ for boxart.
