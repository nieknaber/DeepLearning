At least there are vampires in this one unlike the first Vampire Saga (VS1): Pandora's Box where it was only a hint of vampires. The game has a very vague Silent Hill feel to it. Music has a sense of urgency; and, there's some melancholy music to give you a break from the \\"tension\\". If you love Halloween music, check out the music on VS1. VS3 has a more interesting storyline than the VS1.<br />I just finished playing.  I like it. I wish I could say I love it. The ending might make you shed a tear or two. This game's way better than the VS1. Very nice graphics. Demons. Children who may or may not have your best interests at heart. I especially like the beginning and ending scenes where it mimics a grainy black & white film.<br />Game length-short to medium.<br />I wish the scene where you defeat the demon was more involved.<br />It's somewhat tedious having to go back through 6 scenes multiple times to solve something.<br />There is a hint button. After about 30 seconds, the skip button appears for the puzzles part of the game.<br />The name of the place is Hill Lock when you play the game; although, the product description on Amazon states it as Hell Lock. (The VS2 game, which I have not played,  has Hell Lock on the game cover. What's up with that???) Other than that, it's a pretty apt product description except the game is not quite \\"heart-stopping\\".<br />I might play it again for the graphics, for some of the storyline; and, I just like vampire themes!<br />Update 9/27/12 I am playing VS2. The name of the town is Hill Lock. In VS2 the \\"i\\" in Hill has been crossed out on the town name sign and someone wrote an \\"e\\" above the \\"i\\"  for Hell Lock. Mystery solved.
