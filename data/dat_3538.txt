I can't actually review the game since I cannot play it.  Several months ago a bought a game from Steam and it was the wrong platform (I have a Mac and the product was for windows).  I wrote Steam and they never replied, so I protested the sale with PayPal.  Fast forward a few months, and I decided to buy this game from Amazon.  Well, it turns out that it was a download from Steam.  I tried to activate the download, and Steam would not due to my previously disputed purchase.  I cannot say how disappointed I am.  Steam is a company to STAY AWAY FROM if at all possible.
