Unfortunately, this expansion, as sold by download on Amazon, is not compatible with most versions of Rome Total War.  Amazon customer service does not recognize this as a problem, and does not respond to queries.  Though the expansion itself may be worthy, you are not purchasing it with the above link, merely wasted harddrive space.
