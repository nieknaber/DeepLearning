Good strategic game reminiscent of Panzer Leader / Russian Front style board games.  Greatest challenge for most scenarios is the turn limit aspect.  In terms of re-creating the actual grand strategy of the Eastern Front, the creators missed the mark, which is odd as they seem to be obsessed with realism. Well worth the cost overall.
