I really like it. it is very original! The only problem is that it doesnt support online multiplayer mode. I was able to install configure my ps3 remote to my pc and play this game. just using the keyboard is not good enough for some quest. also the game can get difficult so ask some one to play with you, one on keyboard and the other with a remote controller.<br /><br />see their website support for details.
