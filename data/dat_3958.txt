The game is divided into two parts.  It almost seems like two completely different groups of people worked them and then just set them together for the finished game.  The first part takes place in an amusement park where you are to find a missing person.  Along the way you collect pieces of a record, the Broken Tune.  The hidden objects are easy to find.  There aren't very many other objects in the scene so the hidden ones are pretty easy to pick out.  There are usually only one or two items in your inventory at any time so it's not very hard to figure out what to do with them.  At the beginning, the pieces of the broken record are few and far between.  However, near the end of the first half there is a piece everywhere you look.  I was a little disappointed that the pace had picked up so suddenly, since I thought once I found all the pieces and did whatever I was supposed to with the record, that would be the end of the game because at that time I didn't know there would be another part.  After I found the missing person, who doesn't remain in the game, that pretty much signaled the end of the first part.  Soon after I was transported into a surreal world to continue the second part of the game.  I expected this part to wrap up fairly quickly and was pleasantly surprised that it had several segments to it as well.  In contrast to the first part, which is gloomy, this part is bright and colorful.  The objects are a tad harder to find, but still not super challenging.  And your inventory fills up fast with many objects, although it's still pretty easy to figure out what to do with each one.  This almost feels like two different games except for the theme from the first part that follows you into the second.  Because of the two parts, the game is longer than I expected.  Overall, it was a fun game.  Not too short, but pretty easy.
