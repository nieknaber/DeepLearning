It's a really good purchase don't get me wrong. You instantly receive the code after you buy it and can use it to buy games and music off the marketplace without having to give out your credit card. However, I find it inconvenient that this cannot be used to purchase memberships off the marketplace. I got this to get a 1 month membership, however good ol Microsoft won't let you do this. If your purchasing this thinking you can use this money to get a membership off the marketplace itself, don't get it. If its for games and everything other than that, then go for it, because it's a good deal.
