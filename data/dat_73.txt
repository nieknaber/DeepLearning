Ok, let's be clear - I love the game and played it a lot years ago.  But I can no longer recommend that anyone get this game.  Seems you now must have Steam to play the game and that is just too much of a hassle to bother with.  My son spent eight hours tying to get Steam to run this download to no avail.  I will not buy another computer game if my research indicates that Steam is required to run it.  I have had nothing but bad experiences with Steam.
