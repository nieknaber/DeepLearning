I really was disappointed in this game. I really like Nora Roberts books as well as the ones written in the Eve Dallas series as J. D. Robb. Perhaps if they used the Eve Dallas books to make a game it would be more interesting. It could also have episodes.    Rating game: 3  Ease of play: 3      I really expected more from a Nora Roberts inspired game.
