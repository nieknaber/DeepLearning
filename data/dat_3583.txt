I was nervous of purchasing this game due to VERY mixed reviews, but since I'm a huge Sim fan since the beginning, I decided to give it a shot. I really enjoyed it. At first I missed the open world and the Creat-A-Style from Sims 3, but then remembered how much that made the game lag for me. I wish there were more options for objects as far as color goes, but Create-A-Style was so bad on my computer. The Sims 4 runs so smooth and I've had pretty much no issues with it. I like the new building mode, but I do miss the ability to change the terrain levels and use cheats to make walk-out basements and attached garages. Live mode is pretty fun with the emotions too. All in all, good game!
