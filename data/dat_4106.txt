Oleg Maddox, creator of the excellent IL2 combat simulator series had a vision - to create the most immersive and realistic flight sim ever, based on the Battle of Britain. It appears that time and money caught up with him in his quest to produce this incredibly complex piece of software and it was released well before it was ready. It was made out to be virtually unplayable, patches were produced which helped a little and then support for the sim was dropped by the manufacturer. Darkness reigned over the english channel.<br /><br />Then came Team fusion and ATAG. Team fusion proclaimed &#34;let there be light&#34; and there was light. TF &#34;proclaimed let there be good terrain&#34; and there was good terrain. TF said &#34;let there be better gameplay&#34; and there was better gameplay.<br /><br />A group of unpaid volunteers have taken this code, rewritten substantial portions of it and absolutely transformed the game. ~Having a long line of combat flight sims from Microsoft Combat flight simulator to IL2 1946, I can say hand on heart that this game, thanks to the hard work of a small team of volunteers is now the best flight simulator ever. I say again, it is a flight simulator, not a shoot em up arcade game. You have to operate the aircraft as you would the real ones, they have the same limitations of the real McCoy and the same propensity to bite you if you mishandle them.<br /><br />Forget the original reviews, this sim is now like comparing a Ferrari to a Ford Fiesta over the original versions. You still need a well specified PC and video card to run it well, but the realism is staggering. There is also a very helpful online community at the Air Tactical Assault Group website to help with any questions or difficulties.<br /><br />If you are looking for the most realistic flight sim and have a decent PC, then don't hesitate. At the price it is an absolute steal.
