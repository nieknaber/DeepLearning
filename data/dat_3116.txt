I enjoy Match 3 Games, but have been disappointed with a few that I have downloaded. Sometimes I get towards the end of a game and hit a level that is just too hard for me to finish in the allotted time period, especially without using all the bonuses and time extensions. The Rise of Atlantis is pretty hard, but not impossible. You travel to 7 ancient civilizations and collect pieces of an artifact representing each country over several levels of game play. The games get pretty intense at the last two countries, and bonuses and lives collected start disappearing quick. But the gamemakers are smart enough to give you the chance to get a couple of more chances to recoup your advantage without making it easy to finish.
