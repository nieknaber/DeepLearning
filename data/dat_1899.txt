If you don't have a car, or even have the time to goto your nearest Wal-mart, Best Buy, GameStop or local entertainment store, look no further.  Amazon has $10, $20, and even $50 PSN codes at your disposal!  It ask you to input a credit card for verification (It won't charge it yet) then it brings you to your final submission page.  Once you click submit payment, you get you PSN code INSTANTLY! BADASS!  Will do business with Amazon.com always!!!
