The thing that made me buy this game was that there are no monthly bills in order to play it. That is a very strong positive thing about this game.<br /><br />When you first get this game and go off to create an account, you may have hell just like I. First off is making a password (I am use to using my own passwords), you have to make a password that no one in the game has ever created. At first I thought I already had an account on there since the email box was red too but that wasn't the case. I had to go to an password random maker online in order to make a password. All of that was annoying as hell but it is a one time deal.<br /><br />The best thing so far in the game is that there are 5 different races with different stories and each race has different main quests (as far as I can see). This allows you, if bored, to go off and intake new things. But you can only pick one realm and create up to 5 characters. So unless you go off deleting you won't be able to experience all of the stories.<br /><br />And lastly, this game isn't for people that love to level up their weak character into a proud hero. Every area you go into has a level limit. So if you are level 60 and run off into a level 5 area, the area will lower your level down to the area's max level. This hurts your health, skills, and so much more. Of course they have events that play in the area every 20 minutes or so. This allows you to gather XP, gold, and another form of money so you can buy good stuff. This game isn't for me since I like to level up and see how powerful I have become, but it maybe worth the buy if you play it once in a while when you're bored.
