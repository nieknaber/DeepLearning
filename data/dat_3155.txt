This is by far the scariest game ive ever played. Its different then games like DOOM which get a cheap thrill by suddenly putting a zombie in front of you. This is much more psychological and makes you scared to move forward in the game. The sound track really makes this game great. The levels are really fun and its not just a linear \\"shoot zombies then run to the next area\\" type game. It requires some puzzle solving and has a good backstory. Highly recommended!
