Huge world to run around in, unique art style, complex story (nod to R.A. Salvatore), and a fun combat system make this game well worth the 10$ on this current deal.<br /><br />A quick note: The FOV on the default game make it a bit hard to take on PC and may cause headaches when playing in front of a computer, I'd recommend this little utility to fix it ([...]) Edit: Darn, I guess Amazon removes links, just google 'widescreen fixer' and it should be the first result. I found that around 70-80 FOV felt much more natural. Unfortunately since the company was not together for long after the game's release they were never able to get around to fixing it.<br /><br />I'm currently on my second playthrough (first time without DLC), each DLC seems to be around 10-15 hours of extra content but can be less if you avoid sidequests.<br /><br />Max game time can be upwards of 100 hours or longer if you are a completionist.
