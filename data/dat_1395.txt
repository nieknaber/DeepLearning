This game will not work on a PC.  I just got off the phone with EA tech support and he said \\"THERE IS NO PATCH AVAILABLE YET\\".  The game is so old, they probably will never make one.  I don't know why they are still selling the PC ported version.  You may find some \\"patches\\" on  various blogs but if you use them (they tell you how to reassign keys to make it work) you foul up the use of those keys that you will need later in the game.  At the very beginning of the game you need to approach and open an umbrella as you first line of defense.  You can't open it so you are destroyed 4-5 minutes into the game, game over.
