My initial impression...<br />I have an origin account, download was slow but finally happened, when I attempt to start the game, nothing happens, nothing at all.  Googled the problem, saw many \\"workarounds\\", so I uninstalled, redownloaded, etc...  same result.  Total waste of money and no opportunity for refund.<br /><br />SAVE YOUR MONEY, DO NOT BUY<br /><br />...Finally...<br />OK, after several wasted uninstalls, redownloads (super slow), and trying every workaround posted on the net, I finally updated Java for some other reason, to version 7.17, and then this game started to work.  How the heck am I supposed to know the dependencies of this game?  Shouldn't it's installer check for prerequisites?<br /><br />Only two stars due to the headaches, at least my kid is playing the game now.
