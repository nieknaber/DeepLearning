Great product, although it took awhile to load it was worth it.<br /><br />It does have its glitches, every once in awhile, especially in the beginning it would stop and freeze out which was awful especially since you can't save mid-way. You would have to restart everything. But if you can get past that, and have an okay computer or laptop then it shouldn't be a problem.<br /><br />The scenes are really funny although if you don't know the book or movie I can see it getting confusing, but I really enjoyed them.<br /><br />Game-play is difficult at first but once you play it for a while it gets much easier and I love all challenges and objects you have to find because it means you can go back and continue to play for as long as possible.
