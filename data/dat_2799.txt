I loved the 1st game - this version is OK - but they got rid of many of the GOOD PARTS of the 1st game. I feel the same about Hearts Of Iron. I have played this game many times - there is little historical reasoning in the game - it is all about power, power power.<br />You will find in the game that as a gov't you MUST go always to the \\"Left\\" in your policies or the game will punish you with revolutions over and over and over... it is WAY over done.<br />You have a lot LESS control over the economy of your nation then the 1st Vic. Making colonies is much harder too. The diplomatic part of the game is less too.<br /><br />Why they would spend YEARS in making LESS of a game than there 1st one - I do not know???<br /><br />They need to fix it - I give the game a C+/B-....
