This is for people who get more into the roleplay part of Skyrim than I do. It's nice to have a place to keep my stuff. and I love being able to plant ingredients, but I don't see the point in adopting or marrying. I wish you could change your mind after you've built part of your house, and I wish the display cases were like the others in the game, where all you have to do is have a weapon equiped and it goes into the case perfectly. It's a good add-on, overall.
