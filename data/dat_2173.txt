Of all the Nancy Drew Games, I liked this one the least. I like a challenge, but I ended up having to use spoilers from online to make it through this game. There were good clues to what you were supposed to be doing. Talking on the phone... that was a nightmare. You had to call the right people on the right phones to get through. not a very great game.
