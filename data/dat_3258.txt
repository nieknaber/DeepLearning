Endless Space is a 4x (Explore, Expand, Exploit, and Exterminate) strategy from Amplitude Studios. The game is basically the Civilization series in space. There are star systems to explore which are beautifully rendered, you can colonize and terraform planets, mine and process resources and fight space battle against other space factions and space pirates(who play the role of barbarians in the Civ series). There are eight unique factions to play as or create you own customized faction. Customize your ship with modules, armament, engines and special mods. The diplomatic aspect of the game is designed well and tops the Civilization series in this area. If this sounds like your type of game or looking for something new, you will do well to pick this up.
