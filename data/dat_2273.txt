Just Cause 2 is a third-person shooter in the fictional open world of Panau. You play as Rico who seeks to overthrow the evil dictator of the beautiful tropical region.  Rico has a grappling hook attached to his arm which makes fights lively and the gameplay varied.  The hook can attach to two surfaces at once making it so that you can fix an enemy to a ceiling, or stop pursuing cars in their tracks by attaching the hook from their car to the road passing underneath.  There is no variety of weapons, but fights rarely get stale as combinations of different weapons and the hook make for some great replays.  The story line is not realistic or even well-written, filled with lame tropes and puns, but is enhanced by its own ridiculousness.  Just Cause 2 doesn't seek to be similar to realistic, gritty shooters.  It sets itself apart by its ridiculous gameplay and over-the-top writing.  Even its soundtrack acknowledges the game's intent, containing the sub-title \\"Music to Blow S**t Up To.\\"  As I was playing, I could not stop smiling because even though it was very unrealistic, it was remarkably fun.  Specific only to PC, there are a variety of mods available to enhance the ridiculousness of your experience [...]  Just Cause 2 is not realistic and has a sub-par storyline, but its incredibly fun gameplay and complete open world make this a title to pick up.    Cons:  Weak Storyline  No weapon variety  Little to no character developement    Pros:  Grappling Hook  Hilarious gameplay and high replayability value  Tons of destructible vehicles on land, air and sea  Complete open-world
