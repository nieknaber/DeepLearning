I'm on a bit of a siesta from computer games at the moment, but this game is making it incredibly hard to honor that.<br />Little details such as the AI's ability to duck out of sight after shooting and the rebels shouting \\"Grenada!\\" and diving for cover when you throw a fragmentation grenade near them make this easily one of the best games I've ever played.<br />the vast array of weaponry, from the Glock 18 to a shoulder-launched missile, allows you to find the perfect weapon for any situation and utilize it with deadly precision.<br />I would recommend this game to anyone who likes the adrenalin and triumph of a fairly realistic wargame, especially if you don't need the spraying, gushing blood effects used by so many of the more modern games.
