This is not the way to buy this simple little game. You must-if you don't belong to the online \\"Steam\\" network, download the steam software and sign up for an account there. Steam sells games there as well.<br /><br />I only wanted to quickly download a simple game to pass the time. I like stand-alone games and am disappointed with this one.<br /><br />As it happens, I'm traveling and have a very slow internet connection so I'm STILL waiting to see if this works at all.
