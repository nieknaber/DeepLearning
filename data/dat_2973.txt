This game was a disappointment. DIII has tremendous potential but it seems like the developers just quit before they finished debugging. In many aspects it is much improved over Disciples II but again there are so many bugs that playing beyond the storyline is just frustrating. For 5 bucks, its not bad. You will probably have much more fun with Disciples II even if the graphics are not as great as DIII.
