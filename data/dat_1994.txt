A bargain pick up for the whole of DOOM collection.<br /><br />If you want the experience the world of DOOM as it originated in 1993 here is a pack that's got them all. I am a fan of DOOM and played the first one in 1993 and then every DOOM after wards and now 21 years later I got this bargain collection to experience all the wicked add-on packs for DOOM1/II/III.<br /><br />The Resurrection of Evil addon and the Lost Mission add on packs for Doom III are mostly designed to give the player the terror of dark corridors and tunnels with lots of nooks and crannies to explore.<br /><br />Pros: Sound effects and audio engineering. id  sound creators are the master of finding and creating sound loops for each monster and they are effective to bring a terror to go with them. When you hear them in the dark they bring chills to the spine.<br /><br />THe collection also includes the DOOM add-on in the Ultimate Doom edition, as well as the DOOM II add-on pack No Rest for the Living. These are great to experience again on modern Windows PCs.<br /><br />If you are a DOOM/id fan this edition is a must have at this bargain price.<br /><br />Cons: the Doom III texture is not very hires especially when setting your display on HD resolution. You can try to play around with the LOD bias setting to see any improvement.<br /><br />The Doom III addon packs are mostly corridors and tunnels and they're hard to strafe... there are not much open environments.<br /><br />Master Levels for DOOM II are not included but I guess these are invididually  created levels and not tied into a story.
