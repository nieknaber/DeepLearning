This is a great alternative to driving to the store and picking up a card. Before I used to just buy points through Xbox Live, but they charge tax as where every store sells these as gift cards with no tax on them. Amazon just happens to sell them for about $.50 cheaper than the store, plus it saves me gas. Delivery is just about instant.
