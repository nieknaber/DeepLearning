Although the gameplay is common the story... the story is amazing, you really get into the game and wants to know what happens next and next until the very end. The story is linear, but this isn't a problem in the game, I think that the game wanted to make us think about something and if the story wasn't linear I think the achievment would not be reached by the writter. The bad in the game is that during the gameplay you make lots os choices and they change nothing in the game, I was waiting for reactions of my actions.
