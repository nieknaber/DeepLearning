I bought it at the 5 dollar price point.  Even played it using a xbox controller.  Once you get used to the moves and controls the trick to having a lot of fun with the game is maintaining your speed as you run through, around, over, under, across the obstacles. Yes, combat is somewhat clunky, and disarming really comes down to timing, but most of the time you can avoid combat altogether. Replaying levels is fun to try different routes.  Note however, that if you have an AMD video card, go into the options and disable PhysX to get a huge improvement in frame rates for indoor environments.  I play Metro 2033 on high graphics settings, but I just couldn't play thru the first level with PhysX enabled due to unplayable, single-digit frame rates. Also, screen tearing is awful without vsync enabled. The story/plot is mediocre, the game is rather short, and time trial map pack is just OK...wierd obstacle course levels, that you have to first sign up with Origin service and download the pack through their downloader to get access. Overall, it's worth $20 or less, and an excellent bargain at $5, just spend some time getting used to maneuvering and work on maintaining speed as you run through the levels, and it's a blast, a fun and unique take on a first-person perspective game.
