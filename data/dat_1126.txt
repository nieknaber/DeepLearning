Yup. You may be thinking that with the minor updates (such as traffic, which still sucks) that the game would be worth buying. At least that's what I had thought. I read endless reviews on Amazon yet I still got duped. This game is worth playing, just not in it's current state or at it's current price point. The game is fun for a few hours or for your first few cities, whichever comes first. The game is so buggy and straight up boring now. YouTube may make this game look fun but it's really annoying making the exact same cities over and over and over and over and over and- oh are you sick of this repetitive sentence? Because Sim City is based on repetitive gameplay. $40 (I bought it during an Amazon sale... stupid me) horribly  spent. Please save your money.
