I was seconds from purchasing the $60 12 month subscription on xbox live via my xbox 360 and decided to not be lazy and go check the price on amazon.  To my surprise it was only $48.99 for 12 months and they instantly provide you the code.  I tried to purchase on my iphone but for some reason you can't purchase this on your iphone or mobile amazon app you have to use a computer.  So I went upstairs, bought this, printed the code then 5 minutes later back to playing on xbox live.  Save money and buy here, not xbox live!
