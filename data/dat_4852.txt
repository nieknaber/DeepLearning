I enjoyed this game very much and was amazed at how long it was. The puzzles weren't too difficult and I like that. I don't buy a game for it to frustrate me, or have to go to gamezebo.com to get the walkthrough. And I absolutely HATE timed HOGs. So this one was OK all the way around. I also like the fact that the storyline had a twist at the end. So, overall a great purchase.
