This game could be so much more, but it isn't. For your $10.00 you get a game that has no replay value at all. after you look at the ships there really isn't much more to do. If you are the US navy you have 3 \\"cruisers\\" with 3 gun broad sides, and 3 \\"ship of the line\\" with 4 gun broad sides, these ships are not armored. As Chilian navy you have 4 corvettes and 2 casemate ironclads. The iron clads have 2 main guns per broadside. You meet in the middle and duke it out, but no matter how much fire you put into the ironclads they will not sink. Game has a ton of potinial, but it is not worth dropping $10.00 and I wish I had my money back.
