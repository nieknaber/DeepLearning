I picked this bundle up during a sale for like, $5 or $10 bucks. I had already played the BioShocks on Xbox 360 (excellent games, although I enjoyed the first more than the second), but I decided to try Spec Ops: The Line. I was subsequently blown away - it wasn't exactly the best shooter ever, but it definitely is... an experience, to say the least.
