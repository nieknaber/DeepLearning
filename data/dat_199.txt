I played this game and really loved it, but then it started to crash and now I cannot play it anymore.  I uninstalled it and reinstalled it, still the same thing. I cannot play it anymore.  I am so bummed!!!  It only cost a about $4 dollars so no big waste of money.  Just hope I can find another one similar to it to play again without crashes.
