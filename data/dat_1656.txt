They fixed the pet on November 18, 2013 so users are getting the correct one now.<br /><br />Prior review: Right now, the pet isn't working, you will not get the ship, and if you already had the blurgg like I did, you get nothing in addition to the coins....  I have seen no date on SWTOR's web site or here regarding the fix.
