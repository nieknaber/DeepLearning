Love it! I got this game the other day over here in Seoul, South Korea (stationed there as a U.S. Soldier) and brought ten friends together for a Mortal Kombat drinking game! 1-shot when a player loses a match 1-shot every time a player loses with winner having a flawless victory 1-shot every time a losing player has a fatality done to him  maximum shots a match for the loser 4 (1 loss, 2 flawless victories, 1 fatality) After 2 bottles of wild turkey, 1 bottle of hypnotic, and 1 bottle of crown royal in two hours the real winner was Mortal Kombat.
