Let me get this out of the way first:<br /><br />Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance is awesome, and well worth 30 bucks.<br /><br />PORT QUALITY: Pretty good. There are some hiccups here and there with menu systems which need to be navigated with the keyboard (why can't I use my mouse?), but overall I've had no issues with this game other than the negative mouse acceleration which is described a bit more below.<br /><br />GAMEPLAY: The gameplay in MGR:R is fast-paced and highly-satisfying and some of the set pieces are huge. The first time you cut a guy in half, your jaw will drop. Then, you'll do it a hundred more times and not be tired of it. Part of the reason for this is because of a mechanic called &#34;blade mode&#34; in which you can slice and dice in any direction you see fit. For example, you can cut someone in half at the waist and watch their upper body slide off their lower body while their legs remain standing -- it's very reminiscent of something you might see in a Kill Bill movie or an anime.<br /><br />Part of the appeal of this game is because of blade mode and the fact that enemies rarely die in the same way twice. Want to cut someone's right foot off? Go for it. Decapitation? Done. Or maybe you just want to cut off their right arm so they can't hold their gun anymore, that's fine too. As you can see, there is a lot of room for &#34;creative killing&#34; and it really increases the replay value of the game.<br /><br />There is a lot of variety in enemy and level design and this keeps things fresh. While there are a fair bit of &#34;quicktime event&#34; prompts, they're not too obtrusive. In reality, these quicktime events usually involve some of the most mind-blowing moments that happen throughout the game.<br /><br />GRAPHICS: Beautiful. I have no complaints here and not much to say except that they're awesome.<br /><br />SOUND: The sound effects are fitting and the music helps you get into the action. If anything, I wasn't too crazy about the vocal tracks in most of the songs, but I tended to kind of phase it out after awhile and didn't notice it much.<br /><br />CONTROLS: This is one area in which I have a complaint. There is some kind of negative mouse acceleration going on which can't be disabled, and it's a little annoying. Basically, it means that small, slow mouse movements don't register and this sometimes caused me to die (mainly near the end of the game when precision was required). That said, it's not THAT noticeable, and while it could certainly be better, I feel that it doesn't detract too much from the experience as a whole.<br /><br />REPLAY VALUE: High. There are a ton of unlockables and things to get from playing again on higher difficulties and accomplishing certain tasks. Plus, you get scored at the end of each chapter and some people might appreciate trying to beat their previous score in a level.<br /><br />STORY: It doesn't really &#34;continue&#34; the Metal Gear Solid storyline in any real way, but, instead, branches off on a different path to show what Raiden did after MGS4: Sons of the Patriots. In traditional MGS fasion, the story is told through several cutscenes, some of which are rather lengthy. In fact, the cutscenes of MGR:R are one of the most impressive aspects of this game to me. I was blown away by the animation, the voice acting, etc. The cutscenes seem to be mostly (or entirely) done in the in-game engine and are a joy to watch.<br /><br />CONCLUSION: Overall, this is simply an awesome game which I feel has gone mostly overlooked by the gaming population. It drips with AAA quality and is fun to play -- what more do you want?
