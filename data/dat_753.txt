First let me say this is a great game and roaming around in the Zone is the best part. The game is detailed richly and if you enjoy FPS with some intelligence, not just shooting everything that moves, this is a game worth looking into. But...it needs patched.    **Can anyone tell me which patch is the correct patch for the download version? There are several 1.0005 patches out, a US edition, a Worldwide edition and a Digital Distribution edition, and a Euro edition. Help!? (I'm confused because the download version of Necrovision requires a Euro patch, not an American one. So does anyone know which is the correct patch?
