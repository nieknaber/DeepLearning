I wanted to try this game out after watching and hearing a lot of good stuff about it. When I finally got to play it, it was really fun, but after a while, it can get a little repetitive and boring, but that is just my opinion. Sometimes I still get the urge to play it, but don't really get around to it. It is a good game though.
