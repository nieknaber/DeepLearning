I am extremely dissatisfied with this game and with EA. Their customer support is no help at all and the game plain out did not work.<br /><br />After I installed the game and excitedly launched expecting something similar to the old Need For Speed Most wanted I had logged countless hours on with my old PS2... I was met with a loading screen.<br />After five minutes I closed the program and launched again... same thing. I let it sit for 10 minutes before going to the internet for a possible solution.<br />This was a known bug and after a lot of digging with no solution presented I decided to open a ticket with EA.<br />The response from EA was soon received. It supplied a link and informed me that the ticket was now closed.<br />The link took me to a moderator response on their forums that said they were aware of the issue and may fix it someday...<br />Thankfully Amazon was gracious enough to refund my purchase.<br />Needless to say, when all the uproar over the new SimCity game started up I was not at all surprised.
