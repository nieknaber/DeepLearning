The game play was very good. But for some reason (no changes to my system) the game stopped working about 2 hours into it. I did a \\"repair\\" on the installation, which then asked for the installation disks-but this is a download! Seriously, Amazon, get your act together! I'll try the game again, but if that happens again...
