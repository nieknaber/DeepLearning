I don't usually do reviews but I really love this game and i wanted to add my support.  This game is great for any RPG fan.  To me its like a combination of an elderscrolls game mixed with fable.  I highly reccommend it.  I am sad that the developer behind it went out of business because I would LOVE to play more DLC and some sequels.<br /><br />Sorry that I dont have a lot of fancy words or pros and cons, But all I can say is that if you are a fan of RPG Games and getting lost in a fairy tale world then BUY IT!<br /><br />I also reccommend that if you buy it through amazon and choose the download option, purchase it (but dont download it) Just get the game code from your purchase history and enter it on Origin (EA's download service)to download it from them.
