This game is very unique in terms of diversity, interesting plot twists, and side quests to choose from. There is a wide range of monsters, alternative options, and activities to engage in, so this game definitely has value. However, leveling up takes a while and consequences do result from your decisions (just like Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic). Nevertheless, I'm still playing this game and haven't beaten it yet. I can't wait until the sequel!!
