I recently just gave up Xbox and turned to the computer for gaming, i have a Windows 7 HP Pavilion dm4 I5.  My computer will run many games with decent graphics.....So you cant play the Batman game without direct x 9 and all windows 7 computers have and will run in direct x 11, now way to really change that. So unless you like a game that lags and skips, its useless.  Sucks cause i mainly got the pack for that game.  Just wanted to throw that out there!!
