Purchased this card game series to use on 2 computers.  There was nothing stated or implied in the description or system requirements about how many computers were allowed to use this downloaded program.  Installed on 1 computer but wasn't able to install on a second.  Called Amazon and they were very helpful but unable to get it running on a second computer so I called Encore.  Was told by them that it can only be used on 1 computer and it was stated in the licensing agreement.  I wonder if that was in the microscopic print section?  Why wasn't advertised in the main body of the description.
