Yes, yes, this is yet another DAO player review.<br />But frankly I couldn't help it. I had downloaded the game an hour back and just exited the game after playing for what... 5 minutes?<br />The graphics suck! I have a GTX460 and I am running at full setting. It's not the PC, the artwork is just damn ugly. And whats wrong with the bloody Darkspawn, they might as well be called the Whitespawn now. I mean they could at the very least show a bit more resemblance to the original darkspawn. And what is with the special effects while attacking? This is supposed to be an M rated game, not some 3rd grader's cartoon game! They have even given icons for each dialogue option to show the response emotion, as if I'm a machine who can't understand the nuances behind each response!<br /><br />In short, from my 5 minutes of the game:<br />Artwork - cartoonish<br />Effects - silly<br />In game menu/actions - seriously?<br /><br />My review might seem severe but believe me, even if I had never heard about DAO I wouldn't play this game and it's not as if I paid lots for this game, just 5$. I feel really sorry for all those poor folks who paid in full for this game.
