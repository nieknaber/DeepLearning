Super Mario Bros. 3 came out in 1990 at the height of Nintendo mania. Many, many, many gamers loved the Mario games for being fun to play with and this game took the franchise to a whole new level. If you haven't played this particular NES game yet, shame on you. Back in the days, I rented this game out and was blown away by the graphics, sounds and variety of levels and its challenges.<br /><br />Super Mario Bros. 3 lets you take control of Mario as you guide him through 8 worlds of various themes. They were all packed with stages with plenty of various challenges to overcome with the main goal being reaching and beating Bowser. What made this game remarkable was taking the essence of Super Mario Bros. and expanding it in every way possible. At your disposable, you had numerous power ups to use and many coins to collect to earn extra lives. You even had the ability to save power ups to use later in the game, which proved to be very useful. There were many secrets to uncover so it was worth playing this game over and over even if you beat it already.<br /><br />And now, with the Virtual Console up and running on the Wii, you can download this game for $5. It's a great deal and perfect for the new generation of video gamers who missed out on playing games for the NES. Get this game and pass this on to those who never tried this out and get it if you, like me, missed out on purchasing the original cartridge back then.  ******HIGHLY RECOMMENDED********
