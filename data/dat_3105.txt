After installing this expansion pack and not really seeing much of a difference in the game like I had hoped, I completely uninstalled it and went back to the Sims 3 when FUN and excitement used to exist in the game. The Sims 4 reminds me so much of Sims 1 all over again that I won't be playing Sims 4 anytime soon again. Majorly disappointed with Sims 4!
