It is fun. The story is more of a tacked on last minute addition to give some semblance of an excuse for shooting aliens.     Becomes a bit too easy at the end (once you get the final weapon and enough ammo for it, which is almost consistently level 9 of 10 for me).    Overall, it is a good isometric shooter if you just want to pick up and play a shooter game for the sake of shooting things.    NOTE: To remove the jitters/stuttering when it plays (if you are running it under Windows 7), run it as an admin under Windows XP Service Pack 2 compatibility mode. Service Pack 2, mind you, NOT Service Pack 3.
