For some reason, the Amazon checkout system is prompting me to enter a new credit card even though I have one on file.<br /><br />It also will not let me use my gift card balance.<br /><br />I suppose it is because I am trying to buy the \\"online code\\" version instead of the actual card that would have to be shipped. But it doesn't actually say this anywhere.<br /><br />Overall, it is very fishy to ask me to enter my card when it is already on file.<br /><br />It is as though online code orders are not actually being fulfilled by Amazon... be warned.
