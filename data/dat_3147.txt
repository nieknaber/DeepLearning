This tank was made in Canada during WWII however it was never used in actual combat just for training purposes.<br /><br />In combat of World of Tanks this tank holds it's own even against higher tier tanks.  With the added Gold you get you can use that to purchase a crew with 100% skills which will also allow you to select an added skill for each crew member.<br /><br />The experience gained using this tank can be used throughout the different countries in the game as added experience toward better tanks that you might want to own.<br /><br />I have done rather good with this tank during combat along with a few 'gold rounds' to help punch your shot through the armor of a heavier tank when needed.
