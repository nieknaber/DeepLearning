Well I bought this because I fail to buy the physical collector version when it was on sale. Digital CE I thought might be worth it but I was wrong. As long as you pre order this game I think it's good enough. Digital CE doesn't really give you anything special to help you in game. So I kind of paid $20 extra for basically nothing.<br /><br />The Game itself is amazing. Beautiful graphic and music. It really brings you back to the final fantasy everyone grew up with and love. I think it's a very solid game that just had problems at launch.  A lot of people nerd rage pretty fast about the launch problems. It's been fixed since 9-11-2013. So anyone playing before this date might of reviewed the game itself pretty low.<br /><br />Oh there's a fee per month to play this game. Lets just hope they don't let players down for having that fee up. As of now I wouldn't mind paying $15 a month for a great game. There's a good number of great players.<br /><br />This product version: 3/5<br />Gameplay: 4/5<br />Graphic & Sounds: 5/5<br />Community: 4/5
