EDIT: Before you read further, read this: After reading on some forums a bit more it appears that this game may contain at least some part of the formerly dreaded non-Steam DRM known as Starforce. Lot's of people hate this DRM because it used to be notorious for destroying hard-drives, however, that version of Starforce is not used at all anymore that I know of. Supposedly, it is only used to monitor activations (assuming it is actually present at all) or something but I don't know nor do I care. The game is excellent and I've had not a single problem with it or anything else on my computer since the install but you might care, a lot of people do.<br /><br />---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />Bumped up from my initial 4 stars because it is a truly impressive game. Also, after reading around the net it looks like this game is going to be getting a lot of extra work done to it so that's good. It's not buggy or anything but I hear there's talk of expanding the SP and some additional tweaks in the works. They really did hit a homerun with this one!<br /><br />Back to the original review:<br /><br />Finally, good RTS that isn't stuck in the rut of World War 2 and it's about time! Don't get me wrong, I like WW2 games but enough is enough and the moderm warfare games in the RTS genre just don't cut it. World in Conflict almost cuts it but... eeeeh....<br /><br />I bought this yesterday against my almost concrete rule of never spending more than $20 for a video game but this one was worth it. It would have been worth it at more than the $36 it cost. It is very, very good. Don't believe me? Go see some You Tube videos of it which is what sold me on the game. My thanks to KillerFedexGuy...<br /><br />This is not an easy or casual game at all. The AI is smart and has a knack for exploiting your weaknesses.<br /><br />Besides the AI, the physics are excellent, the graphics are great and the sound is outstanding, the control interface is fairly user-friendly as far as these games go (although I'd have liked it to be a bit smaller) and not overloaded with options, the battlefields are very large and get this: you can engage at realistic ranges! That's right, none of this nonsense of having to park your tanks 50ft in front of the enemy's tanks just to be able to see them. You can see them coming in the distance and you can even fire on (and hit) them. I know... it's incredible right? Wait til you see it in action.<br /><br />For some people it's going to have some negatives and they are:<br /><br />1. It's a Steam game. Oh well... I don't even care anymore. I'm tired of complaining about it. This is the way it is and it's not going to change so we can either get over it and live with it or find something else to do. I choose to live with it.<br /><br />2. It's a gas hog. I run the game on Windows7 64-bit with a 3.2ghz dual-core, an overclocked GTX550 TI and 8gb of RAM. It gobbles it all up (except for the RAM) when maxxed out and you want to max this dude out because it's a gorgeous game. My guess is that low end cards, weak processors and tiny bits of RAM are going to leave you disappointed with a game that will be ugly and very unstable. As usual, my advice is to put almost no faith in the minimum requirements as they are most often only what's required just to get the game to start at the lowest settings. I haven't actually looked at them but it's usually the case that if you're scraping bottom with your specs you're not going to get acceptable performance.<br /><br />3. Hard... very hard. After a couple days I decided to add one more star and this potential third negative. There is no difficulty setting in this game. Well, yeah there is actually three settings and they are Launch,Sadistic and Exit. That's it. Yeah, I found that out when I checked to see if Veteran Difficulty was the default setting. Turns out that it kind of is but by God it's worth it just to hear those tank cannons roar and the flak guns... and... and the auto-cannons... oh sweet Jesus....!<br /><br />Cheathappens dot com has a full trainer for download but not without a paid membership.

The singleplayer at least. I haven't played any multiplayer and possibly never will.<br /><br />Just remember, the game is hard. About Mission 4 it gets downright murderous but it is oh so worth it.<br /><br />As a late edit: I don't know what passes for good graphics or strategy in some people's minds but this game's graphics are excellent and the need for a solid strategy (tactics, to be more specific) in this game is of paramount importance, as is the need to maintain constant situational awareness. And yes, you will see tiny icons when zoomed out and managing several square kilometers of intense warfare but wouldn't you kind of expect to?t just to hear those tank cannons roar and the flak guns... and... and the auto-cannons... oh sweet Jesus....!<br /><br />Cheathappens dot com has a full trainer for download but not without a paid membership.
