You need the STEAM software to download and play the game!!  Luckily, steam has some other good games for sale through their system so it's not such a big deal.  You can even play multiplayer through the Steam system.<br /><br />You play the role of a &#34;vault hunter&#34; sort of an interplanetary treasure hunter.  You get a choice of four characters with very different skill sets.  You can give each character some bonuses (more health, more shields, more bullets in the magazine, faster fire rate, more experience, better skill with a type of gun, etc.) as you level up.  You're on a planet called Pandora, looking for a mysterious Vault that seems to have some treasure or something, nobody really knows if it even exists.  Between you and the vault are space pirates, strange alien creatures, and corporate raiders.  Luckily, you get some nice guns:  acid-round shotguns, flaming submachine guns, and lightning sniper rifles among them.  The GotY edition includes the main game as well as Moxxi's Underdome (where you fight enemy waves for rewards), Jakob's Cove (where you fight a zombie horde), Fort Knoxx (where you fight the army and steal their weapon stash), and Cl4ptrp Robolution (where you help another company stop a robotic revolution).  The expansion missions have unique weapons and enemies, as well as a higher level cap than the main game.  Anyway, if you like shooting space pirates and alien monsters while hunting for a bigger gun to shoot them with, this game will keep you entertained for many long hours.<br /><br />Also, if this interests you, they have Borderlands 2 with a few expansion packs now.  I haven't played that one yet because I can only afford games when they are old and cheap, but I hear it is even more fun than this game.
