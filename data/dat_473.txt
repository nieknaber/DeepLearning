I LOVE this game for PS3! But there are so many glitches in the PC version, that I can hardly even play it! I purchased it so that I could have something fun to do when I'm on my PC, but it took three attempts just to complete the first mission, I give up on my $25 game. This is a shame, because the game is AMAZING on PS3 (and probably 360 also). Do not purchase this unless you also pay for a second computer monitor (as you will punch your current one in frustration.)<br /><br />And to be specific, If I used the mouse for targeting during the second tutorial mission, the man on the roof gets stuck. He won't leave the roof. I just happened to pass this point by doing every single step with the keyboard. And I am only 10 playable minutes into the game! This is on of MANY bugs that are all over the Steam forums.
