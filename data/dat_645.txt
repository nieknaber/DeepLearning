I'd like it more if my computer didn't minimize every 10 minutes with it on. &#34;not enough memory&#34; even though I barely use the memory on my computer. (external drives, duh). Other than that...<br /><br />This is a great expansion pack. From houseboats to uncharted islands to mermaids to owning a resort, this pack is neat. I am a little bummed that there isn't much in the way of clothing. Some cool swimsuits and accessories but all in all maybe 25 new CAS items. I really like the Buy Mode items though. Seashell light fixtures and a new tropical column as well as some new wallpapers. I wish there was more options for flooring but I guess that would make the memory issue worse. This game is pretty large. Like 600 MB! I think its worth it though. You can snorkel and go underwater with the new Scuba Dive skill. I love this aspect! I recommend getting Ambitions and World Adventures as well. They really go together best. I'm getting Into the Future and Outdoor Living next month!
