I just downloaded this game for FREE today after hearing about it on Twitter.  It's a great match-3 game with a twist in that you don't simply match 3 objects just for the sake of matching 3 objects.  You have to break boxes and so therefore you have to select where you're going to match at least 3 objects, giving it a different objective than the typical match-3 game.  Nice music (at least I like it, as compared to another reviewer who didn't like the music).  I'm very pleased with this game and would definitely recommend it.  I did not seeing anything about needing something called Rosetta in order to play it on my MacBook, which is currently running OS X Snow Leopoard.
