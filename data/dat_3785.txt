For only 20 dollars (or however much it it right now) it is a good game that is worth the time put in. The MMO aspects are alright, nothing new, you run dungeons and get gear but the story and atmosphere is where this game really shines through. The single player experience of this game is amazing, and there's no real downsides to the mmo part.
