It may just be showing its age, but there are a lot of things that make it impossible (or at least highly difficult) to play this game.<br /><br />As an earlier reviewer mentioned, the dialog is in Russian. There are subtitles-- which for some reason appear at the top of the screen-- but they go by so slowly that conversations can take hours. At higher resolutions, the screen tears and flickers at times; It also didn't have any choice close to my monitor's native resolution. I never was able to get the Escape key working. So, the only way for me to quit was to alt-F4 out of the program entirely. And when I called up the map, there seemed to be no way to get out of the map display!<br /><br />Now, some games are so good that you put up with technical flaws in order to play them. This game is not one of those. I sure hope they're not charging much for the game itself. Perhaps an XP user could get it into shape, but I'm running Windows 7 and have no desire to go back. This was definitely not worth the price (free plus eight hours to download from Amazon's sloooow server).
