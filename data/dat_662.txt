Admittedly, the game is still a little buggy. The only issue Im having is the occasional/temporary audio stutter/crash. Usually a flick of the cursor and/or ESC key and the game rights itself. The punkbuster anticheat program is a touch cumbersome in its own way, but again not a total buzzkill. I cant imagine too much longer and the updates will right most of the current issues. Then leaving us with the perfect game we should have had before Christmas.
