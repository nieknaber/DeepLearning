If you have Victoria I strongly recommend this expansion.  It adds a ton to the game (you can see the complete list in the description) but the most improved is the colonization. Long story short, colonization is no longer a pain, but really fun.<br /><br />Also don't mind these bad reviews they are all talking about how its only compatible with the steam version (which it explicitly says)
