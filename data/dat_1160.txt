My first venture into ths genre was a House of 1000 Doors by Alawar.  Afgter thoroughly enjoying that game, I got this one.  Absolutely no comparison.  This game is simply a click on a map area and find stuff game.  Way not fun.  Games by Alawar are actually somewhat complex, expansive and immersive.  This game is nothing like that.  It also is very cartoonish looking.
