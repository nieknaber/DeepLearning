Great gameplay AND x-ray, slo-mo nutshots. Cartman would love it. SCORE 84/100.<br /><br />Looks great fully maxed out (I played ultra at 1600p - gorgeous). Fluid movement, good AI (extremely good at higher difficulty), good pacing, and HUGE OPEN WORLDS.<br /><br />Definitely pick it up on sale if you like this genre. You will enjoy the experience and it has some truly unique features. Polishes up Sniper Elite 2 and it just nails what they are trying to do. Story is meh, but what did you expect? It's still 10x better than the drivel from Call of Duty or Battlefield, and much longer too.
