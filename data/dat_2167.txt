I must admit I am a Build A Lot addict. I finish them with a vengeance and then go back to get stars on any level I didn't. This one was the most challenging with the power concerns and there are more games after you finish the first 45 levels of the regular game. Embarrassed to admit but level 45 was tough. 5 tries plus paper and pencil to map out my strategy in order to finish. I did it though.
