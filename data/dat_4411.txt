Calling it sim town still would not be accurate because of the small size. Its more of a village size. Its really a shame that they made the \\"cities\\" so tiny. I like everything about the game except for the tiny \\"cities\\". You start playing and within a short amount of time you run out of room. I would recommend staying away from this game until they figure out a way to make it city size instead of a village or at least the size of a town. Having multiple villages to try and make it the size of a city doesn't help.    I don't know if I believe them when they say its impossible to have bigger cities. They said the same about offline play and they somehow made the impossible happen. I gave the game 2 stars before offline play.
