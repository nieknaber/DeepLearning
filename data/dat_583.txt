First of all, this game is very different as mentioned in previous posts. Before playing this game some research is necessary in order to become acclimated with the game.<br /><br />My only disappointment is with Amazon. Just a couple of days after my purchase, the price dropped 10 bucks. I just think that it is messed up that they won't price match, especially on a digital item within X amount of days. I expected this kind of BS from Best Buy but not from Amazon.
