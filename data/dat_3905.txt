I've had the game for a couple of weeks and I've had no problems connecting to the servers. Make sure you check the recommended system specs. My computer is a few years old and is pretty much the minimal configuration, and the graphics are a little choppy as a result. The game is perfectly playable, but doesn't look as slick as it should. As for the game play itself, it's all right. Given some of the rave reviews I read when the game was released I was expecting something a little more mind-blowing, but it's entertaining enough.
