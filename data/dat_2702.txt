I, along with other reviewers, were skeptical about the validity of this process and if the code actually works and if you even get a code.  After purchasing the Online Game Code, I was told that the process was finishing and would \\"usually take less than a minute.\\"  After only about a minute, the game code was shown, I typed it into my Xbox 360 and the 1600 points were added.  This is a quick and convenient way to get points.
