This game has an excellent atmosphere with unique environments to really draw you into the game. Combined with a challenging combat system, the desire to explore, discover, and fight will remain strong throughout your experience with it. I loved the game.<br /><br />There are faults with the game, such as a not very user friendly user interface. As well the multiplayer component can be fairly hit or miss in getting people to join your game or joining others, but not really a persistent problem. The only real fault I can hit the game with is the resolution being forced at a specific rate. This is fixed with a mod/patch that is available freely on the internet, and is easy to find (expecially if you use steam), however this not being a standard to allow high resolutions is really surprising and honestly disappointing.<br /><br />Despite these negative aspects, this game gets 5 stars for being unique and memorable experience. Last note, it has pretty good replayability as well (played through it 3 times now).
