Easily one of the more memorable 3rd person cover shooters around and a steal at $9.99<br /><br />Pros:<br />Engaging story and good gameplay mechanics<br />Interesting set pieces<br />Good boss fights<br />Handles well with the 360 controller<br />Decent/Good graphic quality (esp after the FOV patch)<br />Decent/Medium length game time (took me 11 hours)<br /><br />Cons:<br />Voice \\"novelty\\" feature is a big turn off, fortunately the command controls via gamepad works well enough<br />Big Bo bromance dialogue during the early parts of the game<br />Unskippable cut scenes (esp after reloading in order to make the correct Trust choice. Fortunately not too many times for me)<br />The \\"Redundant\\" characters - Played through the entire game without choosing/using Charlie/Racheal/that resistance dude when given the choice.<br />There might not be Binary Domain 2 :(
