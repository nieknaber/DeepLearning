This is an okay game. The multiplayer is fun enough, and the campaign is fun enough, the graphics are great. However, it is nothing special, nothing that will change the course of gaming. If it is on sale or something you may as well pick it up, you will enjoy it for a while. But dont waste 20 dollars on it like it did. Its not worth it, especially if you dont have a reallly strong computer.<br />Overall it is a fun game, but nothing you wouldnt find in call of duty or battlefield.
