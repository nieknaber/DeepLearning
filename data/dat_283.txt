Purchased this on sale, and didn't notice it was the Mac version. It redeemed on Steam, and seems to play fine. The game itself, I can't offer a valid opinion on, as I haven't played more than an hour. I just wanted to post this for people unsure if this version will work with Windows 7, and I will update it to include a review of the game proper, after I've spent time with it.
