I passed up buying this for months because of the reviews saying it didn't work on Macs. Finally took a risk and I'm happy to say it works great on mine! Downloaded in less than 30 mins. Takes a long time to load the first time it is opened, but after that speeds up and hasn't crashed even playing as a horse (seems people had issues with this).<br /><br />Installed it on a 2-3 year old macbook pro running mountain lion.
