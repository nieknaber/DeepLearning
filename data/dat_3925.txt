This is by far the worst MMORPG I have ever played in the entirety of my 13 years of MMORPG gaming experience. The game is the farthest thing away from a grind-free paradigm and it will take players:<br />- 301 Quests/Tasks<br />- Visit 512 Waypoints<br />- Visit 721 Points of interest (which are just like waypoints only you can not teleport to them)<br />- Complete 202 skill point quests<br />- Visit 266 points of interest (just like waypoints only they require you to discover a hidden path or complete some form of jumping puzzle to reach)<br />- Acquire 1,000,000 karma (you gain 358 karma per 1 quest but the frequency of quests has been nerfed; so in total you need to repeat 2700 quests).<br />- Acquire around 300 gold (dis-including the rare weapon/precursor needed as an ingredient)<br /><br />To craft 1 legendary weapon.<br /><br />Also, there has been continous nerfs applied to almost all methods of farming gold. It is becoming more apparent that players are being coaxed into buying gems for real money (which can be converted into gold). The economy is rigged.<br /><br />Players who where previously hacking in World vs. World have not been banned, instead, the entire World vs. World paradigm was changed to make it less appealing for players to hack.<br /><br />Approx. 300 players where banned for salvaging items given as a reward to the winters-day event. The item gave more items than used to craft it and therefore anyone who salvaged it was banned the next day with no chance of appeal.<br /><br />A 10,000 post thread on the official forums full of complaints was \\"accidentally deleted while being moved\\"<br /><br />Most dungeons require no team work what-so-ever. Even the latest content (fractals) which introduced a new tier of gear (making your current gear redundant) requires you to do the event 10 times before you start getting the new-tier-gear. A  single event run encompasses 3~4 mini dungeons (means you really have to do 30~40 mini dungeons before you start getting higher-tier-loot) which are fun at first but after doing them repeatedly for so long, feel as if you are dragging your face across broken glass shards.<br /><br />The environment is garbage, telling night from day is almost impossible. I believe they even forgot to put a moon in.<br /><br />Almost all bosses in the game spawn minions that heal them and require players to kill the minions fast or the boss heals to full (which is fine but not when all bosses have the same tactics).<br /><br />Guardians which have heavy plated armour can do a back flip in mid air while carrying a 2 handed sword as big as them.<br /><br />An elementalist can heal better than a guardian, deal better dps than warrior, and run away better than a thief.<br /><br />Thieves (if specced right) can keep attacking other players and going invisible or running away fast enough that other players can not even attack them. Thieves can also teleport using bows, and run 25% faster all the time. A well played thief can single handedly hold a supply camp against 30 inexperienced players indefinitely since he can remain invisible through-out the entire duration preventing them from capturing the camp.<br /><br />*update* latest patch incorporated an event known as \\"Moa racing\\" where players can bid on birds racing on a circular path. The event is a clear rip-off from Final Fantasy's Chocobo Racing<br />*update* latest patch (as usual) has more bugs that required patches immediately after release (just like all updates released so far)<br />*update* New WvW matching system now matches low tier servers (which are normally under populated) with highly populated servers which have players from each time-zone. Needless to say; the low tier servers are obliterated.<br /><br />P.S. looks like 5 ArenaNet employees did not like my review.<br />P.S.S. Most starter zones are totally empty. It took FFXi 8 years before their starter zones became empty, and EVE continues to have players in starter zones 11 years after release. For an MMO to have abandoned starter zones 9 months after launch is a bad sign.
