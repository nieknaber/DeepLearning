Loving the game so far. My experiences with WoW and Guild Wars 2 amount to nothing when compared to this game, and I haven't even played FFXIV for a whole week! I was a bit skeptical about playing a MMORPG on console, but they set up everything very well. Really enjoying the controller's functionality in the game, you can tell they spent a long time on making the controls feel comfortable for former keyboard/mouse veterans like myself. They even gave us an option to use keyboard/mouse instead of the controller if we want. Useful if I'd want to type up something quick in chat or just switch things up one day. You can tell that this game is tailored to the gamer, and I love it.<br /><br />If you're not sure about the game, ask yourself if you really want to log back into your old, forgotten WoW account just to re-live why you quit in the first place.
