BF3 has more of a learning curve than many of the other FPSs out there, but once you get a good feel for the multiplayer game modes/types it is a lot of fun.  With so many different maps (mostly large maps with destructible structures!), game modes, weapons and vehicles the game really never gets boring or feels repetitive.  I sold MW3 partially because it felt like just another expansion pack for MW series and I was just doing the same things I had been doing since COD4 MW, and BF3 was just so much better with all its variety.  The objective based game-play is what makes BF3 so great; I love using strategy and working with team/squad mates.
