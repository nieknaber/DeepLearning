I almost feel as if this is not worth the money I paid for it. I bought the game because I love playing it for free on [...], and I wanted to be able to fight bosses and do an adventure story for it. That part was good, althought extremely short. I'd also played the facebook version of bubble town which was free and A LOT longer than this game. Anyways, after finishing the game, I wanted to play the endless version like on MSN Zone. They didn't have it! I was sad.<br /><br />All in all, I think this game is worth, at most, maybe $3.99. If you like the endless version like on MSN, I wouldn't bother buying this for $6.99 like I did.
