So i bought this game because i am a fan of the C&C series. but when i began to play i noticed that this game was not anything close to C&C. In fact it is unlike any strategy game i have played before. The dissapointment hit like a freight train on steroids. I played a few missions and eventually realized that a four year old could master this game in the matter of 15 min. Not only is it a shame to all of the command and conquer games that have ever come out but this game has shamed all rts's that have ever been produced. i wouldnt even pay 99 cents for this game, temple run is worth more and its free to play. save your money and hope that the next one is an improvement.
