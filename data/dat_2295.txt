When I was a kid, I used to play Contra on the NES to death!  It was quick action and you didn't need to remember what you did last time like you have to do with most RPG.  Some 20 years later, I'm rediscovering that type of gameplay with Hard Corps Uprising!  I dare say that it is way better than the original Contra!  To be hoenst, I'm addicted to it, due in large part to the Rising mode where you can build your character!  It's always rewarding to upgrade your character and play through the same stages to see how much easier it gets!  Don't get mre wrong!  This game is tough, but you will eventually remember the timing and positions of threats on-screen!  I also bought an extra character in the form of Sayuri and she is awesome!  She completely changes the way you play, so it's like another game!  That is also why I'm giving this game 4 stars out of 5.  I wish all the DLC were incorporated from the beginning!  But trust me, Sayuri is well worth it!  Overall, great level design, great graphics and awesome action!!!
