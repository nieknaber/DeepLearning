A Delicious Mystery from beginning to end.  A blend of detective work, horror & sadness.  A choice of 3D or static.  The music by \\"Cellar of Rats\\" is perfect & the Graphics are beautiful.<br /><br />A tragic family trying to ward off a terror they created out of greed.  Definitely a long game with twists & turns.  The mansion's architecture is the key to solving the mystery.  If you like being scared, this game delivers.  Make sure your lights are on when you enter the Chapel!!!<br /><br />I purchased this game via retail years ago & it still remains my favorite by far.  Difficult though it may be, a walkthrough would be helpful for some players.  I cannot believe this game received such a low rating, therefore, I had to add my personal rating of 5 STARS.
