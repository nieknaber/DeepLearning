this game has to be the buggiest game i have ever played. small compact cars can push a large heavy truck wherever it wants? if you t-bone a car, you have to stop and back up? car will flip backward for absolutely no reason or if it hits a traffic cone? spin a car around, and it will pass you within 5 seconds? a car that is many times slower than your car can and will pass you at top speed? a car on fire can and will pass you? MANY, MANY bugs. that being said, it is one of the funnest and funniest games ever. something quite cool about hitting a car and seeing the driver go flying. all in all, it is a great game, replay value is good if you can overlook the many bugs.
