i redeemed the code for the 60 $ gift card to buy a game,my xbox told me it was a code for 60$ and i confirmed it .then i wanted to buy a game but it appears that the money is not on my account even though my credit card has been charged,it seems to be lost somehow,i tried re-entering the code but now it says its already been redeemed.
