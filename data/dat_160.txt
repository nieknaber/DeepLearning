I have been play Civ since version 1 back in the 90's and was somewhat disappointed in version V. In my opinion it lacked many of the standard features the made Civ awesome.This expansion pack makes Civ GREAT. I could go on an on about the new features it brings but that has been done enough just know that if your going to buy Civ V you should get this expansion
