Unfortunately I can't rate this a 0. Purchased this digital content the day it was released so I'm excited because of the content and the 5500 crowns. Installed the game and immediately I noticed I had the imperial content but no 5500 crowns so I'm thinking they are having server issues.<br /><br />The next day I login to the game still missing so I asked others who have purchased this premium content have they received their crowns so they said yes they have. Immediately I open incident with the developer of eso and the same day mentioned to contact sony because they do not see anything about me being owed 5500 crowns. So I call sony and they mention to contact the developer and amazon. So I'm thinking this is getting really annoying. So after days of going back and forth between developer, amazon and sony I still have no crowns so I'm furious. It seems someone else who purchased the ps4 elder scrolls premium edition from amazon is having a similar issue.<br /><br />I hope this review comes across the right people so I can get this issue resolved.
