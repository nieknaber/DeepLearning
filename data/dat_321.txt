TS 12 is a simulator. TS12 is a SIMULATOR. TS12 IS A SIMULATOR.<br /><br />TS 12 is not a game.<br /><br />Why the emphasis on simulator - because that is what this software product does and does superbly; simulate the operation of a train.<br /><br />If one knows little to nothing about trains and how they operate, the details about how to move them safely from one point to another and nothing about how to actually drive a modern disel locomotive, a not so modern diesel locomotive or a classic steam locomotive and one wants to know one will after diving into this software. TS12 is a simulator.<br /><br />Getting tired of hearing that TS12 is a simulator yet? Good! Because if you are a gamer and want to jump in and drive a train from somewhere to somewhere else and get a reward for it or points for completing a mission or become a hero engineer then forget it because that is not what TS12 is about. You can hop into a train and go sight seeing if you wish and that can be a fun to a relaxing exercise. Yep - what every gamer is looking for.<br /><br />TS12 is a simulator and a darn good one.<br /><br />That said TS12 has issues. Graphics are dated - 2010 quality at best. In a town, in a large train yard with minimal activity and even a high end graphics card can get bogged down by a gamer's standards. SD texture vegetation are interlocked planes and those planes show and are ugly.<br /><br />Auran brags on its 242 page enhanced manual. They shouldn't. There's not a lot of information in it. You'll get most of what you learn about operating a train from 4 very well put together and downright interesting and fun tutorials. Too bad the rest of TS12 content doesn't meet the same standard. The rest of the manual covers how to build routes and create sessions. If creating content is your thing and you seriously want to do it for Trainz - plan on divorcing your wife, andoning your kids and shooting your dog because you won't have time for anything else. The learning curve forusing the development side of the simulator is the steepest of any I've used in over 30 years of gaming, scenario development, map building etc. Don your detective hat when trying to figure it all out because you are going to need it.<br /><br />And finally - don't buy the marketing hype about the 100,000+ user submissions and all the content available for download. Oh - it's out there at various places, mostly on the publisher's site but much of it was/is produced by rank amateurs who get the big picture but can't be bothered with details and in TS12 the devil is in the details. TS12 depends on a massive database which must be up to date for user produced content to work the way it is intended to work. Uh huh...<br /><br />I've been downloading what I considered would be interesting content for about 3 weeks or so now. Not one has come across without MISSSING DEPENDENCIES, Dependencies, dependencies... What are dependencies? They are the assets, graphics, scripts etc that make the independently developed content work. Problem is if the developer uses assets not available on Auran's Download station then you've got to hunt them down on your own. Good Luck with that. The process can run from being nigh unto impossible to as easy as a quick google search and grabbing it. I won't even discuss broken dependencies, faulty dependencies, dependencies with errors, obsolete dependencies - shall I go on? No! Let's not.<br /><br />There are some quality 3rd party content vendors for Trainz DLC - if DLC is what you want - and you will if you like Trainz - then that's the route I would recommend.<br /><br />In summary - if you are into hard core simulations (real sims not games disguised as sims) and you have an interest in RailRoading then Trainz may be for you. If you are a gamer then run, run and don't look back.
