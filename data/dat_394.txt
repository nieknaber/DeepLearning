Yes, the marble mini-game does get hard at the end, but then any game worth it's salt will increase it's difficulty during game play. That's what makes it challenging. It may take a few tries and some colorful language, but it IS doable and completely rewarding when you finally beat it. There are a few difficult objects to find. I generally never use hints when playing the hidden object scenes, but I did have to cave with this one. Aside from that, though, it was well worth the money. You won't be disappointed if you are a fan of the hidden object genre :)
