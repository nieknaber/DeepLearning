I didn't get far enough along to endorse everybody else here's problems with Origin, for the simple reason that the download was corrupted in process, and the download program didn't detect it until this morning when I tried to install it (although I had a cute experience where the Origin client wouldn't let me create an account, nor recognize the password for the one I already had - but that's not all that relevant to the review).<br /><br />I mean, come on! This is 2012 here, not 1998. When you download a 10.2GB file, the downloader should darned well verify the integrity of the file before shutting down, and it should have good error recovery.<br /><br />The lack of an option to demand a refund on this disaster that is the digital games library is also infuriating.
