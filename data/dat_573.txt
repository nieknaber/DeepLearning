Fun and better and worse than the Kindle app.  There is a story in this version and the animation is better, however not having a touch screen makes it more difficult.  Tapping the screen just works better to pick up the hundreds of dropped items during a round.  It is fun but it's simplicity and the touch screen make it more of a tablet casual game.
