This is a really fun game, I haven't played it in years though so I decided to purchase a version for my Mac. It downloaded just fine, but when I went to instal it kept asking for a password. I was not provided with an installation password when I bought the game, nor did my computer password or Amazon.com password work. I contacted Amazon and the game developer but Amazon was unable to resolve my problem, and since the developer never got back to me, I decided to ask for a refund.
