This game is different than other HOs in that the HOs are sometimes just tiny shadows or sketches.  You have to have keen eyesight (esp. to spot a boomerang in a bush painted green, have you ever seen a green boomerang?).  Most of the puzzles are easy, but I had a terrible time with, of all things, tic tac toe.  Still I finished this in a short afternoon.  As someone said in their review, there are no skips on the puzzles (hence, my problem with tic tac toe).  There is no time line to finish a section and no hints, although if you wait a while the item will sparkle, so no problem with HOs.  I wouldn't buy this type of game again.
