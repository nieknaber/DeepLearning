A surprisingly melancholy experience, Little Inferno is a captivating piece of interactive entertainment. I say that because it really isn't much of a game, at least not in the normal sense. There are no scores, no real goals to complete, and no enemies to fight. And yet it still manages to get under your skin and hook you from the minute you light your first toy on fire.<br /><br />But, burn, buy, burn, the endless and monotonous grind should be an absolute chore, but somehow I couldn't stop playing the game. Maybe it was the fantastic presentation, that is both charming and creepy do to the fact you are ultimately burning them all. Or maybe Little Inferno is trying to say something about the way games inherently snare us in away from the world, and the fact I was so drawn into it only further drives home this message.<br /><br />I can't honestly describe my experience with Little Inferno, and I'm not even sure I would say I enjoyed it, but what I do know is that it unlike anything else, and absolutely worth playing!
