Before there was Assassin's Creed, before Prince of Persia there was Thief.  I loved this game the first time around on the console, and even though the graphics look dated it's still an engaging game.  A gamepad is something I would recommend though.  all in all still fun and a welcome change from the usual &#34;shoot first ask questions later&#34; first person games.
