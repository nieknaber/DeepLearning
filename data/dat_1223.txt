I can not recommend this game due to the practice of the Developer / Publisher.  Using anything but a premium tank (you pay real money for these) you will constantly be put into fights with higher tier (level) tanks that you have no hope of beating.  A large number of premium tanks are tier 8, which means that if you are tier 6 thru tier 7 medium or heavy or tank destroyer, you will be pulled into these fights so that the Tier 8's have something to easily kill.  The other side will have tier 6 & 7 tanks, but forget trying to fight these tanks; your own teammates will easily kill the tier 6 & 7 before you fire at them.<br /><br />The game and mechanics are fun but after you have 8 high tier fights in a row, it just isn't worth it.
