do not trust this game<br /><br />this developer never asked me what operating system I was running. I downloaded the software, but it will not run. I do not doubt that the software is on my computer, but I'm going to have to go ass and apes to find it. I want my $30 back.<br /><br />About a week later, I finally figured out how to contact Amazon customer service. Customer service was very helpful to me. I did not know what Origin was before I bought this game. Now that I have an Origin account on my computer, the game works fine. My nephew seems to love the game. I haven't played much of it myself. Apparently, since the price went down within 30 days of me buying this game, Amazon will send me the difference of the two prices.
