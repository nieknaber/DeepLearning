I enjoyed playing this hidden object game.  It is mostly hidden object, yet there are puzzles and the need to use inventory items to reveal other hidden objects.  The graphics are clear and the story is somewhat interesting, although can easily be bypassed without diminishing the gameplay.  The hint system is great. You can click on the name of an object to see a sillouhette of it in a lantern or use a hint to see exactly where the object is hidden.  Some of the parts of the game take place in France and then repeat again in New York along a parallel plot line.  I found that a little tedious.  It was an easy game, nothing too challenging, and my 8 year old enjoyed playing along with me.  It took us about 5 hours to complete this game.  It is just macabre enough to be creepy, but not really scary.  The only reason I couldn't give it five stars is that I have recently played some much better games, including a new game by the same company: Midnight Mysteries, the Salem Witch Trial -- which was FANTASTIC.  I would also recommend Mystery Case Files, Dire Grove.
