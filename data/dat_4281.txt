Didn't care for it, I have several operating systems and varying processors and it drags and freezes on every one of them. It also is very slow to load, even when you are simply zooming in. I don't have old outdated machines, most are dual core or quad core processors with NVidia graphics cards and my oldest machine is 2 years old and my newest is only 2 months old.
