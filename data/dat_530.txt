I own this game and have played it many times, over and over again. It was a great game when it came out and the story is still great to play through, today.     Beyond Good & Evil received many nominations in the gaming world, en spite of its ill reception because of its poor release timing. It contains a deep and involving story with plot twists and witty moments. In fact that caused my wife to actually sit down and watch me play a few times and she never ever does that. I highly recommend this game to anyone, as long as you are not just into games that are only about thoughtless violence or the most cutting edge graphics (since real hardcore gamers know that graphics are not what makes a game, they are just the medium used to paint the canvas.)    The other two reviewers that posted before me complained about the graphics of the game, so I will address some known issues since this game was made when Windows XP just barely released SP2: first, this game is considered old now in game years (since these are shorter at times than hamster years)released in 2003, second if you are running it on anything newer than Windows XP SP2 then you will have to play with the settings until the graphics function correctly or you will have glitches galore. This will cause Jade to be hard to control and cause lip sync errors. I think that also covers the control problems. Since I have it working fine on Windows 7 Ultimate 64-bit I think that you can probably get it to work for you, too.
