I read the reviews and figured why not. It's only 5 bucks.<br />It downloaded rather quickly and installed with little or no issues. The graphics are \\"iffy\\" at best, but that may be because there may be an update I haven't found yet.<br />The game itself is ok. It reminds me of Sid Meier's \\"Pirates\\". Wasn't real fond of that game either.<br />I've played it a total of 5-6 hours and found it to be rather difficult to figure out some of the scenarios.<br />It's ok..but wouldn't recommend it to a friend.
