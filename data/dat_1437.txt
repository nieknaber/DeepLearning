After playing the game for 3 months I feel I can finally leave a review.  Let me start off by saying im not a fan of fighting games, but this game is just nostalgia all over. I remember when I was younger anytime there was an arcade around this HAD to be there! So me and my friends would play it occasionally. Neither me or my friend knew what the hell we were doing and would just press random buttons until something came out, lol, it was still fun. But alas, I heard this game was gonna come out for the PSN and I had to get it.  This game is fun, it's fun to play with your non hardcore friends, the reason it gets 3 stars in fun is because it is NOT fun to play online with hardcore people.. for obvious reasons. I was once in a match were this guy KO'd all my 3 characters in less than 30 seconds, GIVE ME A BREAK.  It has all your classic characters unlocked and ready to go, and can be real fun if you put your time and effort in it, just don't expect magic if your gonna play online and you're a newbie. :)
