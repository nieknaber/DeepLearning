The entire family loves games where you find hidden objects and this one has been a hit. Once someone turns it on it seems like the entire family gravitates toward the computer and cannot help themselves as to aiding the person in finding the objects. It has numerous levels that tax your talents. As a family we would all reccomend this to anyone that likes these types of games.
