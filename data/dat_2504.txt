Okay no prob, it accepted the key and directs me to create an account then says it will send me an confirmation email which never comes after multiple times.  Fine, I'll go to the website directly and create an account, same story.  Avoid this game until it is verified that they have fixed the registration problems.<br /><br />Edit 1:  If I could give this \\"game\\" 0 stars I would!  I have emailed the game publisher, etc but no one has the courtesy of replaying back.  I totally recommend against buying any game from this company as customer service is a non issue from them.
