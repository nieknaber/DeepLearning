Yes.. This does run on Windows 7 64-bit. I bought the game back in the day when it came out but couldn't get it to run on my quad-core PC. However, I bought this download since it was just $3.00, installed it and it runs. However you may want to change the resolution in the game to a 4:3 ratio to prevent stretching to wide screen. There is a way to utilize widescreen proper but you have to play around with your video card's software (i.e. Catalyst Control for AMD GPUs).<br /><br />With that said. This is one of my all time favorite games. The music is amazing, the characters are very memorable and you tend to get attached to them, the graphics are still stunning without looking too dated, and it's one of those games that make you demand for a sequel (which last I heard they are still working on it).<br /><br />For just $3.00, you should really get this game if you never played it before. It's one heck of an experience and plays out like a well written story.
