I downloaded this game yesterday afternoon, just to see what this Amazon game thing was about.  I didn't really intend to play much but ended up playing it for 5 more minutes-5 more minutes-10 more minutes.... So 5 hours later after missing dinner and being up long past my bedtime, I finally quit the game.  (This could be a good weight loss tool!)<br /><br />This game is easy to play, keeps your interest (at least it kept mine) and it's fun.  You move from town to town, building homes and estates to each mayor's ideas and you have a certain amount of time to accomplish your goal. It's not anywhere near as involved as a Sim game, but maybe that's nice since you don't have to concentrate as hard.  Two thumbs up!
