You enter a world of little blobs of goo that you use to build bridges to reach your goal - a vacuum that sucks up the blobs.  Some boards require ladders that need to go real high..some boards require bridges that need to span rivers...but watch out, because the higher or longer you go, the more unsteady your architecture becomes, especially if it doesnt have a solid base!  You need to decide how many blobs you want to use on reinforcing your structure, because every blob used is one less that gets sucked up into the tube! Each level has a minimum number of blobs that need to be vacuumed up, and every blob you can get over your requirement goes to a special level where you compete against everyone else in the world to see who can go the highest!  Great graphics, and very imaginative!  And some of the levels require alot of thought! But overall very relaxing and enjoyable.  Love this game!
