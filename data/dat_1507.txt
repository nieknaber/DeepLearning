pc version has many great features graphics are great and a fan of the series.<br />the things i did not like about it was that it told you what to do instead of figuring it out for yourself yes it said do press this and that. would like to have more control of the game. it was more some what of a movie, which was great but need more control of Laura Croft. i give it a 5 stars it was great.
