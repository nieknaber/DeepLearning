Pros:<br />1. Story mode feels like a poorly animated CG movie with similarities to the original live action film's plot.<br />2. Voice chat during online fights.<br />3. The Krypt has returned from previous games and looks better than ever.<br />4. Built-in support for Xbox 360 controllers (common these days).<br />5. Fighting mechanics are very well designed and meant for intense combo-chaining.<br /><br />Cons:<br />1. Story mode cutscenes are unskippable, even if you already watched them before.<br />2. Game does not support keyboard controls well enough to be comfortably playable without a controller.<br />3. Combos require perfect timing to be pulled off, which means newcomers will have a tough time.<br />4. Online fights slow to a crawl when either player has a less than stellar connection.  (May be a good thing for some people.)<br />5. Characters can no longer use environmental traps and weapons.  There are a few characters who use weapons, but those weapons are combo moves.  Environments are basically very boring, similar to Street Fighter IV.<br />6. The Krypt's content is a little on the boring side compared to the content found in Deadly Alliance or Armageddon.  For example, no videos.  I'm not sure about this, but I believe there are no unlockable characters in The Krypt.<br /><br />Final verdict is that the game does not offer anything new for MK fans.  Armageddon had a create-a-character feature, which this game simply does not have.  This game also does not have any minigames, like chess or kart racing.  Armageddon expanded on the adventure mode, which is no longer offered in this game.  It doesn't have unlockable characters in the Krypt, either!  The fighting system is simplified and feels a little dull.  I still like the game, mind you, but you could have a lot more fun with an earlier MK game if you don't care for online competitive play.
