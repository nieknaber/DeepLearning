Don't buy this! I bought this and it was a huge mistake! My buddy Frank warned me that this game feels like it was released in 2008, and boy was he right, I wish I listened to him. My wife won't even watch me play, that's how bad it is.<br /><br />Go watch Angry Joe's review on YouTube to get a better idea of how bad this game is. Trust me, and trust him! I watched it after playing this game. He shows how garbage the combat is. I don't even feel like a pirate in this game. I feel like a pathetic landlubber, so much that my wife has started calling me that when she's angry. (Which seems like every day. Am I right, fellas?)<br /><br />But seriously. Don't touch this with a ten-foot pirate pole.
