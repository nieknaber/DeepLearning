I never was a big viky fan.  I played the first viky a little bit but I was mostly a europa universalis and hearts of iron guy.  Victoria II makes many great  improvements over the first one and its a lot more user friendly.  The UI only takes a few minutes to get used to and the learning curve was about an hour for me to understand the basics and start playing effectively.  However if you never played a paradox grand strategy game there is going to be a huge learning curve and your going to have to invest a lot of time not understanding things and not going anywhere.  However if staring at a map managing resources and trying to build up a country sounds like fun then I would give this a try.    If you are a paradox guy and know what your getting into then I would absolutely buy this title. If your coming off of hearts of iron this is less on war strategy and more on nation building.  However the combat system is good but not nearly as deep as hearts of iron.
