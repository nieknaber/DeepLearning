I went to every store on the 13th looking for Seasons but no one had it.  Finally went home frustrated and tried to buy the direct download from Origins...payment kept being denied no matter which account or card I used (even paypal).  Finally came here and was pleasantly surprised to find a direct download.  I have never had any issue with Origins so it wasn't a big deal for me.  I saved a copy of my game onto my desktop, took out my mods folder (VERY important to do btw),updated Origins & updated my graphics driver.  After that, the install was a breeze.  Updated my mods, and have been playing crash free with no problems since.  I have a 4 year old gaming computer that I have upgraded myself and have never had problems playing The Sims.  I'll definately be using Amazon direct download for anymore Sims EP's or SP's that come out.<br /><br />I only used mods by Twallan.  He updates his mods when a new patch comes out.  You just download & install his new update from his website.  I can't speak for other mods but his are well tested and have newer caused issue after he updates them.
