The scale of FIFA 14 is immense.  There are a whopping 631 teams in the game, including 47 \\"International\\" teams which you can use to recreate World Cup play (USA, Brazil, England, etc.).  There's a roster of 272 \\"Free Agents,\\" and an in-depth Create-A-Player you can use to fill in the gaps.  If you were like me, watching the 2014 World Cup group play and thinking about [[ASIN:B000EVMK4Y 2006 FIFA World Cup - PC]] or a past FIFA experience, FIFA 14 is a must-have at its current $18-20 price tag.<br /><br />There are two ways to go about getting FIFA 14.  You either get the online game code from Amazon, or from Origin, EA's gaming client.  I bought the digital deluxe version of FIFA 14 from Origin directly, and the cost was $24.99.  The download included 1,575 FIFA Points (FP), which are used ONLY for FIFA 14's featured game mode, FIFA Ultimate Team (FUT).  You don't need FP to play FUT, but it sure helps.<br /><br />From what I've read and experienced, FUT is nothing but a money sink, but I wanted to try it out anyway (hence the purchase of the deluxe edition).  It's fun, but at the end of the day you need to keep your players going by obtaining contracts every 13 games, per player, for a 23-man roster.  The frustration adds up.  Everything else about the mode is fun, and there are over 200,000 live transfers available from the online community right now, but needing to obtain player contracts is tedious busy work.  I would only play FUT if you are willing to spend an inordinate amount of time doing things other than playing games.  It's a beautiful single-player experience (or entirely online experience if you want it) enhanced by an online community, but that also means you need Internet connectivity at all times to make the mode work.<br /><br />Anyway, and thankfully, while FUT feels like a Facebook game on steroids at times (I can't tell you how many hours I clocked into the Madden card game on Facebook), you don't need to play FUT to have fun.  Navigating themenu might take some time, as well as the controls (I still dread penalty kicks and the like as I have no idea how to operate the goalie), the UI will grow on you over time.  I use an XBOX controller for PC and it works great.  It even has the ability to skip songs via the \\"Back\\" button.  On that note, be sure to Google how to change what tracks play, as it's confusing at first, and half the songs are skippable.  I'm in the process of finding out how to replace a lot of them, or add my own, which seems like an easy enough fix.
