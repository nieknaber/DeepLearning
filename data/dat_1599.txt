First off let me mention that I have played every farm sim out there, the simple fact is that farming games are a niche market. Most people find it relatively boring which I can understand takes a certain type of person to keep interested. The companys have limited resources so theirs not going to be activision or ea quality, which some people expect. Agricultural simulator does a good job of being a lot more detailed than the competition aka farming simulator etc. What always drove me nuts about farming simulator was the physics and bland graphics, sure its got mods but majority of them are buggy or don't interact with the game very well.<br /><br /> Agricultural simulator to me feels more realistic graphically and physics are more believable. Weather is implemented real well, along with a help section that pops up with f1. Tracks show up behind the tractor as well as dirt accumulates makes the vehicle interact with the enviroment. It is a headtrip at first starting out might feel a little lost, if you do check out forum  section at  agrar-simulator.de theirs an english section their or use the in game help menu. From what i read when it was first released it was very buggy but from my experience playing everything works fine. When i first installed the game a large update was applied which i assume fixed what plagued it early on. I had zero problems installing the game and don't see why anyone else would.
