The game is average. It's good real time strategy for beginners (don't know how to spell, 2 g's or 2 n's or what, it's late). The city size is too small and there is not enough variation in buildings, lacking some real features of city planning, some sims are not very smart is a little frustrating. User guide is very poor, not enough info on much of anything.  Good intro for people new to SimCity.
