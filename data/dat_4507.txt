I waited till Sunday the March 10th to download and play and everything worked fine.<br /><br />All the people on here crying about the injustice of having to wait a few extra days to play should seriously reevaluate there values system. EVERY TIME theirs a major launch like this there's issues, why would this be different? Wait 5 days. Most of you have been waiting 4 years, now EA needs a few extra days to iron out some server issues and its the end of the world!<br /><br />I seriously hope ALL of you crybabies get your refunds cuz i don't want to plop my city next to some crybaby Mayor, seems like you would be bad neighbors.<br /><br />Look past the start up/ server issues, get this game. its awesome!
