This game is basically an expansion to the Tools of Destruction story and the bridge between that game and the soon to be released A Crack in Time.  So if you are unfamiliar with the story line in ToD, there will be plot points that won't make a lot of sense.<br /><br />That said, this game still offers all the fun (humor), action, and platforming adventure that the Ratchet and Clank series is acclaimed for.  So even though you might not know what every plot point is relating to, the game will still deliver all the humor and tight gameplay you expect.<br /><br />Concerning that gameplay, due to events in Tools of Destruction Clank, is not in this adventure (you're basically looking for him in this game).  This isn't a huge deal except that some actions that you would expect (if you've played previous R&C games) like hover jump are absent - but they really aren't missed.<br /><br />In short, this game is a perfect extended sample of R&C gameplay for those new to the series.  The game is a tad on the short side at a 3-5 hours but the discounted Amazon price and the sheer fun this game provides, makes this an easy recommendation.  Highly recommended to longtime fans and anyone who plans on completeing the story arc started in ToD and finishing in aCiT.<br /><br />Edit:  At time of writing the offer price was less - must have been at temporary sale price. At full price the game is harder to justify for casual fans IMHO.  Though for hardcore and less price sensitive fans, this game gets a full recommendation at the full retail price.
