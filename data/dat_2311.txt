This is not an issue of launch bugs. It's poor planning and a bad business model.<br /><br /> A milestone game from a franchise this central to an entire genre of games should have been much better prepared for.<br /><br /> The always on DRM is a TERRIBLE decision, and it's the main thing keeping people from playing right now. Online play adds a whole new level of depth to the game but it should have been OPTIONAL.<br /><br /> Additionally there is no reason why we should not have been able to pre-download this game and have it unlock for play at release time. All these issues with people's preorder codes not working would have been resolved as soon as the code went gold, instead of them having to complain about it on forums to people who don't care and make fun of them for having spent money on a product they aren't being allowed to use.<br /><br /> This attitude is the reason why this type of thing is still happening. Launches CAN go smoothly. New gameplay modes CAN be implemented without breaking the original playstyle that many people bought this game for, and NOONE is not justified in complaining about paying for goods and not receiving them. So, PLEASE, stop with the mentality that this is an okay way to run a business.
