It is hard to believe that Nintendo's biggest stars is celebrating the upcoming 30th anniversary of Mario Brothers, Mario and Luigi. Yet out of all the Super Mario games and classic titles that Mario and Luigi have each played from the original NES era, none of them has been more exciting than Super Mario Brothers 3. The game is still as challenging as Mario and Luigi is on another quest trying to save Princess Toadstool from the clutches of Bowser, whom was absent from Super Mario Brothers 2 in America, but was never apart scheming his way to get the princess in his life. The game is still just as fun and challenging to play as it was back in the late 80's, when it debuted in the Fred Savage film The Wizard. It really brings me back to the days when games were more about fierce gameplay and excitement, than blood or gore and shooting at others. This game is truly a classic and Nintendo set that standard so high in games. If you have never played Super Mario Brothers 3 before and own a Nintendo Wii, I definitely recommend downloading it from the Wii's virtual console.<br /><br />Game: B+
