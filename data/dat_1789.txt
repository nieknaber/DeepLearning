Disclaimer: I have not played the game other than loading it up to check it out. (I'll get through my backlog eventually right?)<br /><br />To be honest, I didn't like Far Cry 2 at all. I quit early on and never went back.<br />But as I saw more and more of Far Cry 3 prior to release, it looked good. It perked my interest. I am pretty eager to play this.<br /><br />I impulse bought this game for $7.50 on a sale. Even if I don't end up liking it very much I know it will give at least that value in entertainment. Probably much more though.<br /><br />Nice and easy, it activated on Steam along with 95% of all my other games.<br /><br />Here is where my real problem is. It's a Ubisoft game, and they make you install their U-Play client on your PC. I hate that. I don't need another client on my PC. Worse yet (or is it better?) it doesn't even do anything. It doesn't validate the game, or launch the game, or pretty much anything. It just gives you access to the U-Play online information and ability to purchase things etc... Even worse, it isn't even linked to one master account. I have a handful of games I signed in via consoles and those are not linked to my account.<br />So this all really irks me, and I feel I need to state it all here so other customers know what they are getting into. The details state that it uses Steam as the DRM, but it says nothing about requiring U-Play.<br /><br />Is it game breaking or a reason not to get the game? No. But full disclosure should state that you need it.
