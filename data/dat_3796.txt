No instructions, per say, comes with the program (Mac/PC version).  It states there is an imbedded owners manual on it, but there is little information about how it works.  If you are used to TAB instruction, this is kind of backwards and confusing, but after a little time it is fairly easy to figure everything out.<br /><br />Installed it and it worked fine.  Played with it for about 20-30 minutes.  Started it up the next day and it worked fine for about an hour, then the input from the guitar started to break up and crackle.  I tried another guitar, then tried another USB port, but same problem.  Shut down the computer and restarted, but the problem continues.  Checked the Rocksmith forum and found that the cables seem to be a problem.  They say the 60 day guarantee to learn how to play, but nothing about returning Rocksmith if you don't like it.  Could be a good program, but bad cables and no real instructions make it 2 stars.  If they fix these items, it would be 4 stars easy.
