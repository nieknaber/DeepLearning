I really enjoyed this game, a lot. The action is there, the story was there, and everything seems to be on key. However, it feels like it's more on the lighter side of content even though this is the &#34;Ultimate Edition&#34; I expected a little more characters, stages, costumes, and re-playability.<br /><br />Just to bring it to attention, this isn't the next big thing in the fighting genre as it uses the Mortal Kombat game engine. So basically all it is, is a watered down Mortal Kombat with DC characters. But the game does a good job of masking it with it's deep story and unique atmosphere.<br /><br />If you enjoy playing fighters for fun or if you are a comic book fan who loves DC then I recommend this for you. But if neither interest you it's best to pick this up on sale via Amazon Digital or Steam for $5.
