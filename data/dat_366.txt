The game is broken on day one - they had no idea how big SimCity was.  It shouldn't be on their servers - I should be able to play whenever I want and not have to be connected to their network.<br />The game is way too expensive - $60 for a game that doesn't work and on top of that they had DLC already setup to buy.  You had to pay $90 to get the full game - what a terrible price.  DLCs should not cost money on the day of release.  Greedy EA.
