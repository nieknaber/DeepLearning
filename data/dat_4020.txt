This is the first full version of a Delicious game I've played and I was pleasantly surprised. Now while the other games were good, this one is definitely one of the best management games I've ever played! I highly recommend this game to anybody who enjoys management games. The graphics were nice, the story was cute, and it keeps you wanting to play more and more! They have plenty of levels set on one difficulty and once you finish all those levels, you can switch to a more challenging setting and play it all over for a different experience! I love that you have the ability to do that. Also, buying the full version unlocks premium levels and items. So, if you're planning on buying this game you'll receive every little bit of awesome-ness the game has to offer! I love this game! It's a nice treat for management game lovers!
