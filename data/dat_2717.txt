I need my multiplayer fix. Since this generation it is mandatory, I will gladly pay for it. I get free games every month for 3 separate systems!? What a deal! I've been playing games I wouldn't otherwise and played enough games that made me save a ton of dough, that in itself pays for it alone. I don't know how Sony is doing it but am glad they are doing it because I love games and if you do, get a membership and enjoy!
