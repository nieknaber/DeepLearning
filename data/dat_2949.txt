bought this when steam was working properly I managed to play modern warfare 2 and rogue trooper just fine for about a week on multiplayer on mw2 then steam started having connection issues but my connection is just fine wifi is working with all bars I tried making two steam accounts after the second account I thought id finally be able to download it and play it. now I cant play all three games!!! it says it needs to have connection to download mw2 again on my first account and it downloaded black ops on my second account but is having problems installing it saying steam servers are busy its basically a loss of $40.00 id prefer the disk version right about now
