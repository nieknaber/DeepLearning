Thank you Mastertronic for sending us a review copy of this game!<br /><br />Kitty Powers is a video game drag queen that's starting up a dating service and you're in charge of its success.  Clients will be lining up and looking for love.  Will you help them find their soul mate?  In this game, same sex marriages are allowed and your clientele will include hetero, homo, and bisexual individuals.<br /><br />Before you begin playing cupid, you'll be asked a bunch of questions to determine your personality/love type and your avatar will be mingling with other players online.  If you run into a girl named Anita Bath, that's me.  And no, that's not my real name.<br /><br />The clientele will have different tastes and unique traits.  They will start by telling you what gender preference they have (if any) and their favorite hair and eye color that they are attracted to.  Depending on their tastes and affluence, the selection in Kitty's black book of eligible mates will be limited, no matter how many pages you have unlocked.  In other words, it's highly unlikely that you'll be able to pair up a millionaire with a hotel toilet cleaner.  As your matchmaking reputation grows, you'll be able to attract more affluent clients.  While they are harder to please, they do make it worthwhile financially.<br /><br />You will virtually (through cameras and ear pieces) accompany your clients on their dates, selecting the food and conversation topics in an attempt to steer the couple towards a relationship.  In the beginning, the restaurant choices are limited and you don't want to take your date to the same place twice.  Picking the restaurant is a two part process.  You first have to select it and then you have to try and pick it again after a game of shuffle.  Whatever you pick after the game of shuffle becomes the destination.<br /><br />There are many mini-games of  chance in Kitty Powers' Matchmaker.  Topic conversations are chosen through a jackpot style machine.  Again, you don't want to have the same conversation twice, and this rule carries over to subsequent dates.  If your jackpot results are not in your favor, you can nudge it (for a fee) to offer a different conversation topic.<br /><br />When it comes to ordering a meal, your date will have some restrictions that you'll have to take into consideration when ordering.  If you're unsure about a dish, you can ask a waiter about it for a small fee.  There are Steam achievements for learning about all of the meals from every restaurant.<br /><br />Having a successful date takes a lot of work, especially during the unexpected events.  For example, you never know when flatulence will strike. To effectively hold it in, you have to win several rounds of a higher/lower card game.  There will also be times when the couple disagrees.  I like how this game gives you the option to and rewards you for telling the truth.  If you do decide to lie, you'll have to spin a wheel to determine if you can pull it off or not.<br /><br />At the end of the date you'll sometimes have to flag down the correct waiter (be sure to pay attention!).  Also, keep a calculator handy if you're not good at math for calculating the tip amount that your date specifies.  When the taxi pulls up to take you home, you have to make a decision to go steady, go on another date, or just be friends.  You only have three chances for a successful relationship or else the client will take his business elsewhere and your reputation will get dinged.<br /><br />As you level up, your office will undergo renovations and unlock new features like the ability to kick a client to the curb if you so desire.  The business will also advertise to various locations and attract new types of people.  You have to make romantic connections with hipsters, geeks, sporty, and edgy people.  There are Steam achievements for making unusual matches like a practical and an artsy person.  If you manage to hook up fifty same sex couples, you'll earn the gay prideachievement.<br /><br />When a couple decides to go steady, you'll see a scene with them in a hot tub (wearing a bikini if applicable).  They'll do some air kisses and make smooching noises.  That's the extent of the love scene.  I wish this game was voice acted as the gibberish noises are a little silly.<br /><br />Despite its quirks, Kitty Powers' Matchmaker is a charming yet funny dating simulator.  If you don't mind blatant LGBT overtones, there is a lot of fun to be had here.  The $9.99 price is reasonable on PC and it is available for even less at $3 in its mobile forms.achievement.<br /><br />When a couple decides to go steady, you'll see a scene with them in a hot tub (wearing a bikini if applicable).
