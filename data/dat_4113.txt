This is fantastic game....wonderful graphics....very touching story.<br /><br />Some people complained about the controls on this game.  This is due to the fact that without a game controller, you have to control both brothers with the keyboard at the same time.<br /><br />If you plug in an Xbox controller, the game will recognize that you are using it, and the menus will change to recognize it.  And so each brother is controlled by one of the analog joysticks by one player.<br /><br />So why do I write this....well, I wanted to play the game with my son, with him being one brother and me being the other.....several people complain about not being able to control each brother individually.  Well.....here is how I got that to work...this assumes you have both an XBox controller and another usb controller of some type.<br /><br />1. Download xpadder.....there is a free version(ver 5.3) that works with windows 7 in compatibility mode.  Configure it to work with your other usb gamepad(not the xbox one).  Mine is a Saitek P880.  Since the second brother responds to the arrow keys and the right control key, assign those, through xpadder to be clicked when you move the gamepad analog sticks and a button.  There are great instructions with the application and it only takes about 10 minutes to setup.<br /><br />2. Once that is done...unplug that gamepad.  Plug in the Xbox controller or wireless dongle(that is what I have), and start up the game.  You will notice that the game sees you are using an Xbox controller.  Now, plug in the other gamepad and xpadder should assign the gamepad stick and button to those keys on the keyboard.  So the game thinks you are using the Xbox controllers and the arrow keys, and it works great.!<br /><br />My son and I are about half way through the game and are enjoying it tremendously..!!  It is a beautifully done game, and the fact that I can play with him has made it that much more fun.<br /><br />I am not sure it is relevant here....but might sway some people toward buying it, if they could play with two people.  It does make the game a lot less complex in doing several of the tasks, but he is young, and wouldnt have enjoyed it as much trying to control both joysticks.
