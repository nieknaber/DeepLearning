Solid randomly generated roguelike. The progression and randomization is fun, and the music is great. The only real issue is that if you don't like how you spend your skill points, you are out of luck unless you reset.<br /><br />It also goes on sale on steam a lot. Buy it for $5 and play it until your fingers bleed.
