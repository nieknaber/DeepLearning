Sure, your runing around the same city from saints the 3rd.  Sure, its always nighttime and you wont see the light of day till you beat the game.  Sure, the game is shorter then the last game.  All that is forgiven because, im my opinion, running like 200MPH and jumping over buildings is SWEEEAAT.<br /><br />This game feels like a better built crackdown to put it in simple terms, or even a way better prototype.  Imagine the free roaming powers of prototype refined and with the humor from saints row together, and BAM!  you have saints row 4.<br /><br />So like all my other reviews i wont going into the story for spoilers issues, but rest assured, its still bat!@# crazy like before, and doesnt take itself seriously at all.  Its very refreshing to play a game that knows its a game, and not trying to be a epic like movie or novel with its story.  Massacre half of the police force in still water and then jump onto a building for ten seconds and your home free.  Is it realistic, oh lord no, but thats the point of the saints series.  The game itself took me about 16 hours to beat with 94% of the game done, its not as long as the last game but it feels more focused. What also helps, is honestly still water loses some of its charm when your not driving around a lot of the time, and just hoping over buildings following your gps to the next location.  Luckily, at only being 16 hours or so long it doesnt overstay its welcome, and just as the powers are starting to feel stale, the game wraps itself up.<br /><br />Now, i havent played the console ports of the game (and i havent heard anything good about them) but threw my playthrough the game ran at 60fps solid with no hiccups.  The game glitched out on my maybe 2x the entire time, but its a open world game, and as a open world game thats actually very impressive.  I was using the 360 gamepad and that had no issues for plug in play.<br /><br />Im not the best at going into gameplay aspects but all i can tell you at this point, ifsaints row 3 was one of your favorite games of 2011, 4 wont let you down.  Even if you feel that it should of just been a expansion, it still would of been a crazy FUN expansion.  If the saints row games havent clicked for you yet, i would say stay away from 4, it wont do you any favors.  Also, as a side note, if you havent played 3, you should def.  play 3 first, not only is it dirt cheap now a days the story is a direct sequel. Wont ruin the game if you dont, but it helps a lot with who the characters are.  In the first 3 minutes of 3rd you will know what saints flow is, without it you wont get a onging joke that goes on through the whole game.
