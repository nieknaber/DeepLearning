Too many things wrong with game. 1. I takes a very long time for it to respond, when I would click on the person or ask it to move or next turn, it can take upto a minute to respond. 2. My saved game got corrupted, can't open it. There are just too many bugs which renders the game very difficult to play or unplayable.
