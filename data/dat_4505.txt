If you like puzzle games where you match three in a row, this is a fun game to add to your repertoire. I have no clue how many levels there--I'm on 346 right now. The game starts out easy and then of course increases in difficulty. However, unlike some match three games, it isn't so challenging that you can't complete it without tearing your hair out. The puzzle pieces vary game by game so you don't get bored seeing the same match-three items!<br /><br />Great bargain for 99 cents!
