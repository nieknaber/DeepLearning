I bought the game originaly when it was first released , same issues persist , has great crafting, nice advancement into game content, same as all games now a days with no dedicated healers ur left at the mercy of trying to kite stuff to kill it even in the 4 mans and stuff , atm there are no games that have a wow feel , so they hype the games up sell a bunch of copies then toss it on the back burner , it has no support , gold farmers are everywhere , china kills anything they touch , they killed this game the first time and killed it again after reloaded , game companies think ok atleast the gold farmers are subscribing but heres the deal , gold farmers pay while players pay then players get sick of the spam and bots and leave , that leaves the gold farming Chinese bots , but they leave cause no ones buying the farmed gold company is toast , same with all the games now , rift wow lotro dnd aion aoc even eveonline is suffering from letting china in for a week 2 years ago echonomy still hasn't stabilized , ive given up on almost all games mmorpgs anyway , EQ next is releasing and they've decided to use the guild wars 2 thing with weapons and abilities , so I don't expect it to get many sells after the initial release 4 moves get old especialy going thru 80 levels 1 1 1 1 2 4 3 lol not hard to make a bot using 4 moves ,  kk my suggestion save ur cash do not buy this game ff14 - I joined with over 200 friends weve all left , thanks
