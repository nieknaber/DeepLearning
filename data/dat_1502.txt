Great trilogy, had so much fun playing them all, story was absolutely stellar, and I love the characters.<br />Gameplay is almost the exact same as MF2, but still pretty good.<br />Story is great as ever.<br />Missions, main line is a bit short, but there are plenty of side quests to keep you busy.<br />The end, was bad in short. Without spoiling it, all I can say is there is no closure and will leave you confused and asking questions.
