This game is absolutely stunning.<br /><br />(My MMO background: FFXI, WoW, Aion, FFXIV, SWTOR, GW2.)<br /><br />After purchasing this game for a steal since it went B2P I've been so hooked up that I have been neglecting my other games, I no longer even log into GW2 which I thought was pretty great, this game is so good that it will probably put the rest of your games on the backburner.<br /><br />Why is it so great?<br />First of all the modern day setting, it's awesome to run with your character through London, NY, Egypt, and many places more, the clothing, the weapons, it really feels like you can connect better with your character because it is way more realistic than the rest of the MMOs.<br /><br />Then we have the great storyline and quests, I had never in any other MMO been so excited to find a new NPC that I can chat with or that can ask for me to investigate stuff for him, kill a creepy monster that has been bothering them and so on, some quests even require you to learn, morse code, binary (took me back to college days) and overall mathematics, in which other game can you say you had to learn a bit of those to be able to decipher something, hack into a laptop and whatnot.<br /><br />The voice acting is superb, most of the characters you encounter have the real feeling of being badass, being super scared, they feel like they are really covering something, it's great to get to know more of the world just by how a character speaks about a certain subject or issue.<br /><br />Then there is the character progression, there are no defined jobs or classes so you can pretty much create your own, acomplish any role, use any weapon, and you can &#34;re-spec&#34; any time you want as long as you are not in combat. This is so great it deserves a review on its own but maybe I'll add it later.<br /><br />So to sum it up, people spend $50 or $60 for console games sometimes to find out that the game sucks or that it is great but it ends just after 10 hours, this game asB2P, it can deliver 100++++ hours of fun for a bargain, I would encourage any gamer, any conspiracy fan, any X-Files fan, any progression fan, any completionist, anyone who likes great fiction, pretty much anyone to try out this game, give it a chance, you won't regret.
