This game is a cute HOG. The storyline is sweet & a little sad at the end. Didn't last very long though. The graphics are GREAT!! The mini-games are pretty cool & not too easy. You can actually go back to the mini-games after you have finished the game. You get different level \\"trophies\\" in the mini games. If you are an acheivement junkie like me, you go back to get that \\"gold' one LOL! The HOG isn't very hard. I agree with another reviewer in that you dont go back to any rooms as in other HOG's; which is kind of disappointing.The hunt for smaller ghosts was cute. Just not a very challenging game but was a cute one.
