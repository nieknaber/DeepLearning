First off, I bought this game for $4.99 on Amazon and they sent me a promo code worth $5.00, redeemable in January.  So the game cost me -1 cent.  The game is very good.  Not brilliant but good.  I was able to take the key and activate on Steam.  I am not so sure why people are so against steam.  I have never had a problem with steam, not on my old crappy laptop or my newly built gaming system.  Game 5/5  Price 10/5 (free is always epic)  Steam 5/5
