Alright, so BioShock is amazing. Originally, I had only played Infinite and was looking to go back and play the first two. I'm so glad that Feral made them available for the MacBook. I have a MacBook Pro (2012 Retina Display) and BioShock runs wonderfully on it with maxed out graphics. I played through it with a PS4 controller, as I don't enjoy using the trackpad and don't own a mouse. As the game comes, you can use a PS3 controller and 360 controller. If you wish to use a PS4 or X1 controller, just email Feral's support and they will answer you by the next morning with the file you need and instructions on how to get it to work. It's incredibly simple. Feral offers wonderful customer service.<br /><br />As for the people with download issues, I live in an apartment building with terrible internet speed and BioShock downloaded in 2 1/2 hours for me. I downloaded Borderlands GOTY as well, but this downloaded much faster.<br /><br />As for the game itself, it's legendary of course. Just Google it. There's no way any gamer, serious or recreational, would ever want to miss a captivating story like this. Definite +5 game ever, up there with Half Life 2, Uncharted 2, and others. So glad it's available for Mac! Sadly Steam doesn't offer the Mac version for the first two BioShocks, but thank God Amazon does!
