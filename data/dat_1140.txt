This is an awesome shooter to purchase. Open world, good controls and many ways to play the same game. The story is decent but its all about the open world and freedom you feel while playing the game. Great shooter for its time and worth at least trying out. The Multiplayer is a bit lacking compared to other games but its fun and once in a while a good change of pace.
