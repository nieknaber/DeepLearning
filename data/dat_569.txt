So after a week of playing the game I log into my origin account to find that SimCity is missing from my games.  Thinking this was just a fluke I attempt to launch the game from my programs menu only to find it asking for an activation code.  I enter the code I received with the game and I receive an error stating the code has already been used.  I decided to use Live Chat to contact customer service since phone support is a 2 hour wait.  I was connected to a live chat agent after 45 minutes of waiting. The agent informed me that EA deleted my game because of a chargeback or because they believe I received the game from a suspicious source.  Well I purchased the game from Amazon.  The agent said their senior management team made this decision and there was nothing he could do.  I called Amazon and they informed me that this was not the first report they received and they are compiling the list of customers this happened to and are taking it directly to their contact within EA.<br /><br />As far as I'm concerned this is theft.  EA has stolen my money and apparently that of other legit customers. I am waiting to hear back from Amazon but I will be reporting this to the BBB as well as my state's Attorney General's office.
