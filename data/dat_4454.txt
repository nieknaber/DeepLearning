I7, 330M-1G Nvidia, 4G RAM - Can't play it on minimum graphics... But looks like it will be really pretty when I get my Alien....    UPDATE: Purchased a new gaming rig: I7-2600K @3.4 Ghz,8G ram, Nvidia GTX 560-TI- 1G.     Now the game runs smoothly on High graphics - OK, of you max out the graphics. (I probably should invest into a second Nvidia GTX 560 and SLI those puppies. I am on chapter 1 and I am still not very impressed (mind you I loved the 1st one ). Graphics are superb, but so far the quests are very typical, there are a number of mini games that happen throughout the game which kinda bug me and the fighting stiles were simplified. I still have not figured out how to use mutagens and most of the game mechanics are not well explained... I am sure this is too early in the game to rate it, but a few people below are demanding an update.
