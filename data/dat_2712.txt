Gentlemen, I really need your help badly.  I just purchased Drakensang: the river of time and downloaded the game (four hours on my cable) and it doesn't even start. I get an error message only saying \\"d3dx9-41.dll not found\\"  please download again.  I don't even know what that means and I don't want to download it all over again,  not knowing if that will fix the problem.  If it's some line of code that you can provide for me through another download,  or something else,  please let me know by E-mail,  because right now the game is useless.  [...]  I'm hoping that you will get this message using this medium,  since there was no other avenue available.  Please contact me as soon as possible.  thank you Kenneth Holmberg.
