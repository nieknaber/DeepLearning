What a fabulous game. I would give it 17 stars if I could, it is so much above the ordinary! Machinarium is a mixture of pure puzzle (such as solving a moving marble puzzle to open a lock) and inventory-based adventure game (such as picking up a flower stem, which later you will plant in a pot in another building).<br /><br />You're in a wonderfully drawn and painted world inhabited by robots. There are no words spoken when robots interact. Rather you see thought balloons with a little video that moves the story along, or a pictogram or figure of an item that a robot wants. The way emotions are portrayed without words is inventive. Reminds me of the movie &quot;Wall-E&quot;.<br /><br />The protagonist is just as cute as Wall-E. He's a little robot who's sweet on a little girl robot. Unfortunately, there are bully robots, and their evil plans must be thwarted.<br /><br />I thought all of the puzzles were pretty challenging and some of them are DIFFICULT. My family got tired of me muttering to myself, &quot;No, that doesn't work. Maybe if I move it this way.&quot; Only one puzzle, to defuse a bomb, is timed, and if you don't make it in time, the game dumps you back to right before you started working on the bomb. I &quot;died&quot; the first time, but what was good (for me) is that what you managed to learn the first time still holds true the 2nd time, so the 2nd time I didn't need as much time and defused the bomb.<br /><br />If you need a hint, there's a little lightbulb over the scene. When you click on it, it gives you a pictogram of what you need to do next. The lightbulb didn't help me much, because I generally knew what I was supposed to do, I just had trouble finding out how to do it. I'm not sure why I couldn't figure right away that bringing bees into the oil pub to distract the bartender was the way to get the barrel out the door - HAH!<br /><br />There was only one &quot;puzzle&quot; that I really didn't like and that was the giant one at the end. It's like a pac-man game where you have lives and after you unlock a gun you have to &quot;get&quot; 33 red evil robots in order to finish the puzzle, including finding the buggers as you go from one screen to another trying to make your way through a maze. I don't appreciate games like that and I'm not good at games like that (the latter contributes to the former, of course!). Though I could tell that it was much slower, etc., than real pac-man, I still had trouble (reflexes of a slug) and just got annoyed that I had to do this to proceed. Brain-puzzles I love. Reflex puzzles I don't. BUT - I'm sure most people wouldn't have trouble with it, so there you go.<br /><br />This really is a one of the best games I have ever played.<br /><br />Happy Readere a pac-man game where you have lives and after you unlock a gun you have to &quot;get&quot; 33 red evil robots in order to finish the puzzle, including finding the buggers as you go from one screen to another trying to make your way through a maze.
