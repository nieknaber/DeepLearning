I bought it on whim but mostly for Metro and Stalker (which alone make up for the price tag), but in the end I think Im going to atleast try everything except Homefront(which I already played and am well aware of how much a stinking pile of crap it is). This is also my first time buying digital from amazon and was delighted to find that all products have unlock codes for steam, you just: copy the code , press +new game at the bottom of your steam library and then enter the code.
