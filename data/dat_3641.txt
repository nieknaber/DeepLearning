I have to try and provide a review for this game because I enjoyed playing it more than once. I thought the graphics were beautiful and really worked well supporting the story. I liked the puzzles because they were not too hard but were challenging enough be entertaining. For advanced players, this game may be too easy but for players like me, who just enjoy a game that provides some hidden object along with other minigames to move the story along, it was perfect.<br /><br />My complaints are minor. I wish the map would allow the player to jump to the scene rather than have to \\"walk\\" back and forth to the areas that indicate something remains to be done. Also, not everything is indicated on the map. For instance, when pieces of paper must be found to be reassembled their location is not hinted at on the map. You just have to revisit each scene and search for active areas all over again.<br /><br />That said, I recommend this game.
