I don't like it!  Way too much smoke and fireworks, can hardly see the coins and jewels falling through all the sparks!  After a few minutes of play I get a headache!  Recently got a new computer and was unable to transfer the original Luxor onto the new computer, so my husband purchased this one for me... waste of money!
