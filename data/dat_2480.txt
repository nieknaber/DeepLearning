This game is not anywhere near the experience it touts to be, marred by dull additions, a plethora of missed content from previous entries and truly void of any stability, this game which is well beyond post-launch is a complete mess. The visuals which looks muddy and unimpressive on even the highest settings will crash even the mightiest computer, the game controls on KBM are likely some of the most atrocious ever experienced by this user, and the lack of content that basically affords this game nothing better than a F2P experience with neater toys for those who buy from the online store with physical cash. A sad lack of multiplayer experience even on a LAN network, this game is a massive step in the wrong direction and a cash grab from EA for the dedicated fans who they know will buy them.
