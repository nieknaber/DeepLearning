I have to admit I'm a bit partial as I have always been fascinated with Edgar Allan Poe.  Even so, the graphics are very nicely done as well as the effort to keep the game somewhat challenging, but not frustrating.  Scenes set in various parts of the world are entertaining.  The objects are fairly easy to find without being an insult to one's intelligence (there's always the option of available hints from the Raven or the shadows in the lantern).  I also liked the bit of interaction with characters in solving the murders of both Marie and Poe.  I think MumboJumbo has done a wonderful job producing a graphically beautiful, somewhat educational (regarding Poe) rendition here of pure leisure relaxation.  It's hard not to enjoy this game (even if you're a \\"hard core\\" HOG person)!
