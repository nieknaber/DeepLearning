im having the same issue as everybody else but for those who are saying nothing happened,look at your account details on the top right of steam where your username is and the first thing that comes up is LICENSES+SUBSCRIPTIONS/STORE TRANSACTIONS and underneath that it should say NBA 2K14 but you still cant download it or it wont show up in your library and my guess is steam has to put the game up first, so even though its bs we have to wait when it was advertised to be out at midnight, just stay patient and it'll be up by morning. Im glad the Bf4 beta starts soon so i dont have to deal with the disappointment of waiting for 2k14.
