Been playing for about 6 hours now and I have to tell you, its a great game. Assassins Creed has a great story line, so if you have not played the others, consider playing the previous ones before tying this one out as you will not understand the concept. Amazing graphics - (On everything Maxed. I mean everything.) and tons of interactions. Its like a movie, but your still playing 98% of the time. Lots of twists, side missions and tons of exploring. Take your time through the game or you will not get the full experience!<br /><br />That is all I have to say. Enjoy!<br /><br />Side note. Dont buy this game unless you have a good computer. It does require a lot of processing speed and GPU (graphics processing) as well. If you dont have the recommended requirements, I recommend repurchasing a console version of this game. (unfortunately less graphics)
