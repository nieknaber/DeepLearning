I'm one of those people old enough to have had played the original X-COM series, and I can say that the remake was well worth the wait. The new game lives up to the expectations, but will also easily draw in new fans blissfully unaware of its origins. The only minor problems I had with the game is a paucity of maps and the lack of base attacks which gave the original more sense of urgency. I hope these are addressed in the future DLC.
