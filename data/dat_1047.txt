I downloaded Sims 3 and Sims 3 pets at the same time and it look just over 3 and a half days to download. After installing the Sims 3 I create a sims family and buy a house. Moments later a small window pops up stating \\"The Sims 3 Has Stopped Working\\" and i am forced to shut it down. This has happened many times and I am very frustrated and dissapointed with this whole process. I want a refund on both of my purchases!
