I first tripped over this version of solitaire mah-jong as a freebie online.  I enjoyed it a lot, and was unhappy when the website I visited stopped offering it.  As a result, I was very pleased to see it available as a download here at Amazon.<br /><br />If you like your mah-jong basic, without bells & whistles, elaborate backgrounds and odd power-ups, this is the version to get.  It won't overstress your CPU (graphics are simple), or your speakers (music available but not overpowering, sound effects are simple and charming). Good for a quick game when you have only a few minutes to unwind.<br /><br />There's enough layouts to keep you challenged, and satisfaction in boosting your high score.  A great game for a very reasonable price!
