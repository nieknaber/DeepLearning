I've been a longtime fan of open-world/dungeon puzzlers like the Zelda series for a long time. This generation of consoles I would rank Darksiders II equally with Skyward Sword in terms of overall enjoyment and mechanics.<br /><br />++ Jesper's music is brilliant!<br />++ I love Death's new mechanics compared to War.<br />++ Story makes way more sense than Darksiders I.<br /><br />-- Itemization was terrible.<br /><br />Overall a good game, I look forward to the possibility of Darksiders 3 and 4. Someone please buy Vigil Entertainment.
