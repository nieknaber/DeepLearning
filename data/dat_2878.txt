This was a pretty nice game when it worked. Most of the problems in the games plot were ultimately solved by fighting. The game has a pretty detailed skill system, especially with combat skills. With the pretty bleak situation the character finds himself in,(being a convict on an alien planet)this game may be a bit frank for very young children in its portrayal. I give it two stars at the price I purchased it at, I think over $30. This is because almost from the beginning the game stopped working at times and now doesn't work at all. With the quality of the game, which was good, it may be worth the risk to you at $10.00. I wouldn't at all regret what I originally paid for it if they'd ironed out those bugs first. I have Vista, I don't know if that has anything to do with the problem.
