The game itself was weak, the hidden objects were way too easy, as were the puzzles, but I would have been generous and given it three stars were it not for the truly horrible acting in the voice-overs.  All were pretty bad, but I have to single out the person who played Turino as the absolute worst.  Her inflections could be outmatched by a 2nd grader reading from a telephone book, and she somehow pronounced every single name incorrectly.  Normally I couldn't really care less about the voiceovers, but these were so bad as lower the quality of the game, so I'm taking another star off.
