I was looking forward to the story.  But after having finished Mars War Logs and The Walking Dead not to much before that, the interface on Bully for what should have been a similar game just down right stinks.  It is too bad really.  The cut scenes are good.  The acting has been well done for each character I have met so far.  All very good stereotypes.  But its a real big bummer when you get back to working your character because the port is so bad.  There are other issues too, notably that for me the sound does not work right.  Once the game starts, I cannot adjust the sound volume from my hot keys.  A problem for me when the wife complains.<br /><br />I will make an effort to play it some more and give it a fair chance but at the moment I cannot recommend it for any reason.  I bet this was a cool game on the console, but it is another excellent example how porting games from console to PC can go real bad.<br /><br />Hail Flavius!
