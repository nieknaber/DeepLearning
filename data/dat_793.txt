Well you don't really need a review for this game if you have not played the 1st one.<br />If you like the 1st one, 2nd you'll love it. Its more or less the same style. Skill trees<br />are so so.<br /><br />Runs great on 5570 ati card(55$) playing 720p on 42\\" tv.  While running gaming pc with gtx 660 ti(1080p) maxed out, pc at 50c, compared other games at 72c.<br /><br />Didnt notice much graphical differences when I set it up. Couple fancy effects that nvidia has.<br /><br />I was thinking this game was going to be \\"demanding\\" in system requirements, I guess not.<br /><br />Playing offline lan, works great, very low latency. Co-op only reason I bought this game.<br />Co-op is VERY fluid with lan anyway, I lag with normal steam active internet connection.<br />For co-op its excellent, not like saints row the third, where everything gets tossed around, co-op is<br />prety bad I thought.<br /><br />Xbox controller/scheme works as well on this, so you can use both mouse+keyboard or combo whatever you like.<br /><br />I'll for surely enjoy this game for the time being. Only bad thing is, game will die out eventually, since<br />leveling is quite easy. Wish they would've of lowered experience rate at higher levels.  Collecting guns and<br />stuff will make game enjoyable only.<br /><br />You'll meet the older characters from borderlands 1 later in game as well.
