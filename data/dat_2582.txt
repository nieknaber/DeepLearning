So I bought this game a while ago and just haven't been able to finish it.<br /><br />It's not a bad game at all. The cinematics in the beginning are stunning, and I love the soundtrack.<br /><br />But the gameplay is just so repetitive. Every mission is just going somewhere you're not supposed to be and taking out guards.<br />The maps are also really boring. It's a cool design style but I really wish they'd change it up a little bit.<br /><br />Also, the voice acting is absolutely horrible.<br /><br />So, I wouldn't say that you shouldn't buy it, but for me, I bought it and played it for a few hours and haven't been able to get into it since.
