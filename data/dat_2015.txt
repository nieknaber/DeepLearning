The game sucks, the delivery system (had to go via Steam) did not work, got this refunded. The company have turned what used to be a fun intuitive strategy game into a turtle paced globule of nothing at all. I am guessing that those who find budget spreadsheets and corporate memos really exciting might enjoy this game.
