Ok, This is my first review ever on Amazon, I've bought over $100k worth of items on Amazon, I feel so strongly about this POS that I have to write something.<br /><br />This game is buggy, you can not play it for more than 5 minutes without it boosting you out with some kind of errors.<br /><br />I installed patch 2.1 correctly, still same issues<br /><br />Installed patch 2.1.1 still crashing!<br /><br />I don't mind the always on function, but I just paid $19.99 for a POS that I can't even play.  I've tested it on three different computers. THREE!!!!!!!!!!!  Same issues, crashes and buggy as hell.<br /><br />DO NOT BUY!  There tech support is horrible, the forum is full of bugs reports and such but no updates to fix.<br /><br />They are scamming you out of your money, DO NO BUY!
