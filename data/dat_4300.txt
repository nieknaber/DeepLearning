The game mechanics are decent... Somewhere between arcade and sim.  The trouble is, this game has been abandoned by Atari / Eden.  The DLC content is only available by purchasing Atari tokens which are no longer available, so many of the cars are not available.  Bikes were supposedly added, but I can not get the bike pack to download and there is no tech support available.  The supporting forum and website were halfway renovated then abandoned, leaving a jumble of html code and broken links.  Online play is buggy.  This could have been a great game if it wasn't forgotten during Atari's restructuring.
