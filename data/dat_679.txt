The game is pretty complex, and on top of that, it has a high cap for the beginners. You would have no idea where to begin or what to do. The tutorial was, although thorough, did not really tell me what to do with the game. Then again, I'm probably too stupid to grasp the idea. I heard so many good things about the game; maybe it's just not for me.<br /><br />Played about a total of 20 hours or so. Yeah, I know, not much time to actually love the game.
