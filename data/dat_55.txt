I am a loyal fan of the series and I must say that the company is doing its best to improve the game every year. Football manager is for the people who get bored playing pro evolution or fifa without friends. If you get bored of all the games and playing and winning with automatic movements you have learned by heart, then you should give a try to Football Manager. It is definitely the best of all in its type. Every year there are complains of crushes and small problems which are usually solved by the company in one month or so with patches.<br />The main idea is that you manage a team and you do not control the players movement in matches. Rather you deal with day to day situations, none of which is boring.<br />Watch out though, it s addictive!
