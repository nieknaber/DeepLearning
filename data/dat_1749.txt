I held off for quite some time to purchase this game because of all the negative reviews. I'm glad I picked it up and could decide for myself. This game got tons of poor reviews from users, websites, and esteemed gaming organizations. After 20 hours with the game I have to truly say I don't know where the poor reviews are coming from. I'm having an absolute blast with the game and it definitely reminds of the great times I had with Jagged Alliance 2.<br /><br />Here are common complaints:<br />1. It's not turn based - Who cares? The pause and go system is just as good. Once you learn how to use the tactics of this system it's miles more advanced then the previous slow paced turn based system.<br />2. You can get cheap kills by drawing out the enemy with noise - WE DID THIS IN JA2!!! What's more fun then mowing down stupid AI? And some AI still stay back and protect entrances and windows.<br />3. Can't access inventory from world map and you have to pick up items off the ground vs world map - I agree this sucks. It's time consuming and makes inventory management a hassle. But i'm not going to stop playing the game because I have to spend an extra 5 minutes.<br />4. Armor wears down too fast - I agree. I picked up a sweet spectra chest piece and it was down to less than 50% durability after two sectors. But guess what? I took a ton of hits. If anything it gives me an appreciation for the armor i've found and prevents me from charging every enemy.<br />5. Merc's are expensive - I equip them with the extra gear i've found in the field. Yes they get overrun. But I haven't had a problem going in myself and clearing out the invaders.<br />6. The game isn't polished enough - That's what patches are for. At least I can play the game as-is now then wait several months down the road and not be playing it.<br />7. Characther portrait looks like a 10 yr old drew it - Get over it and play the game.<br /><br />Finally, I want to say again how fun this game is. I believe the harshreviews are unwarranted and coming from bitterness then they didn't create a perfect remake of turn based combat. As this game gets patched and modded I truly believe we will have something great for years to come. The pause and go system is excellent (once you understand it) and seems to be a way in the right direction.
