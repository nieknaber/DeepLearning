This game had a lot of things going for it with the main game changer being the True Action Combat system.  For MMO players, this was a huge change from your standard target an enemy and mash your keyboard.  However, this combat system got really boring for me, really, really fast.  Add to that the fact that the quests are about as boring as watching paint dry (at least the starting quests) and it led to me just not enjoying the game.<br /><br />The biggest issue for me was I cancelled my subscription to the game shortly after giving them all my credit card information simply because I was just bored after playing the game for a few hours.  I never recieved a confirmation that my subscription would not renew, but it did!  So, I was charged for another month and was not given a refund because there was no proof that I canceled it in the first place.  This game had a lot of problems the first few days when it came to setting up subscriptions with people being billed right away before their free 30 days was up.  Hopefully I am not charged again now that I have canceled (again) the membership.
