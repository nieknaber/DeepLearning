Updating my review from one star to one star, just wanted to say I'm glad I gave this game one star way back when it came out because take notice. Cities Skylines, which recently released, is exactly what we true city builders were looking for. EA refused to listen to the fan base and released SimCity how they wanted it, which in my opinion is garbage. I can't remember the last time I played. Wait until this game ends up on the bottom rack of the 4 foot long software section at Target with a $4.99 price tag on it before you buy it. It's that bad.
