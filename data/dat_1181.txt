This game certainly lived up to the previous games in my opinion. I have played many of the other games in the Nancy Drew series and this one has a proper place among the rest. The puzzle were great and there were certainly plenty of them. It also was a bit scarier than most of the previous games, which I also enjoyed. If I had one complaint it would be that there were not enough locations to visit; you spend most of the time in the same place doing puzzles. However, I still found the game well worth the money and would recommend this download as opposed to buying the actual CD. In order to start the download you must go to your amazon game library to get the code for your game. It took longer than expected, but it was still much quicker and cheaper than waiting for the game to come in the mail. Inou must go to your amazon game library to get the code for your game. The game was not memorable enough for me to want to buy the CD.<br /><br />Overall I think the game earns 4 stars for the length, the number of puzzles, and the cheaper download price.
