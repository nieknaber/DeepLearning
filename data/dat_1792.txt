Okay sure, it's a short DLC and for some that's gonna be a big letdown, but if you're someone who loves the main game and got really invested in the characters (especially Ellie) I still think it's a definite buy. It tackles something different (I feel) than the main game does, it's more playful and shows a different side of the world than what we see in the main game. It also brings something new to the characters that you wouldn't get if you'd only play the main game.<br /><br />It mainly focuses on events leading up to the main story from the perspective of Ellie. Anyone who have finished the main game knows how the story ends, but its the path there that brings something new to the table. I've tried to be as ambiguous as possible so not to spoil anything but still intrigue people into buying this DLC. So again, if you love the main game and its characters, and care more about that than necessarily only getting a few short hours for your money - than BUY IT :)
