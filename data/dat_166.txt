I love the Sim City franchise, but EA completely blew it this time. EA must have known that this was going to be a huge game and yet their servers have been off and on since launch. For those of you that don't know yet, you have to be online on EA's server to play the game. This is a natural progression I understand, but if the experience is going to be marred due to the online experience, maybe they should have waited for Sim City 6.
