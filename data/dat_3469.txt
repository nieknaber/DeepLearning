I was lucky enough to do game testing for this indie game. From the start I loved the classic \\"Clue\\" and \\"Monopoly\\" boardgame style of the artwork and game pieces. The characters have campy little descriptions and quips throughout the game. The game play is quick, fun, compelling and intuitive, without being too easy. What starts out as romp through the roaring twenties in a high school mystery worthy of any Nancy Drew eventually reveals the dark tabloid underbelly of the provincial close-minded community. The game has lots of twists and turns with a variety of possible outcomes. There are always little hidden gems of plot and back story to be discovered.
