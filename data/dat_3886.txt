I worried about ordering this game, because so many Windows 7 users had problems, reported here at Amazon, and on the BigFishGames forums.<br />I played using Windows XP Compatibility Mode, and I had no problems.<br />The game itself was just okay.  I wasn't crazy about the artwork, and the puzzles were all very simple.  The story was choppy, and ended very abruptly.<br />But it wasn't bad, just not on a par with some of the better games I have played.
