This one can really be as fun as the previous series. Maybe a little bit more \\"frightening scripting\\" and a bit less punch in the basic weapons, but this with the new graphics earn a lot more realism. Same good old enemies (maybe strange to newcomers to the Series... lot's of bones really). Graphics wise is amazing, but fun wise (the real purpose of that game) would have been more limited than before, but... they included the huge hammer, and it REALLY IS a lot of fun, and a new way to approach the enemies (literally). It is very good overall for people not looking for a deep storyline or a perfect realism.<br />Well, what the hell I like the series, I'm a fan, I'm not entitled to do a honest review.<br />Cheers.
