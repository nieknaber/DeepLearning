I had the same issue with other user. While installation, anti virus program pop up. To be safe, i don't want to install. I contacted Amazon and ask for refund. They require for me to speak to tech support over the phone. The cost is too little for me for me to go all that trouble. Amazon should refund a software they sell that cannot play.
