I HAPPEN TO LIKE THE SIMPLE GRAPHICS AND CONTROLS OF THIS SERIES OF GAMES AND HAVE SPENT M ANY HOURS WITH  ITS PREDECESSORS.<br />IF YOU LIKED KINGS BOUNTY OR THE WARRIOR PRINCESS, YOU WILL LIKE THIS ONE.<br />THIS IS A LONG HARD GAME AND IT IS A GOOD IDEA TO PLAY THE EASY OPTION THE FIRST TIME THROUGH..<br />SAVE YOUR GAME OFTEN AS IT WILL STOP WORKING AND YOU MUST RESTART AT THE  LAST SAVED POINT.<br />THIS IS A PROBLEM THAT THE PREVIOUS GAMES OF THE SERIES ALSO HAD AND I NEVER HAVE  SOLVED.<br />IF YOU ARE DOWNLOADING THE GAME, PREPARE FOR A LONG TIME OF IT. IT IS VERY LARGE GAME.<br />THERE ARE A LOT OF IFS AS TO THE GAMES VALUE BUT THE PRICE IS RIGHT.<br />ALSO YOU WILL HAVE TO PUT UP WITH &#34;STEAM&#34;,  IF THAT IS A CONSIDERATION FOR YOU.
