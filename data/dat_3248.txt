To me, most MMORPG's have a very limited appeal.  I really like the social aspects of most games while grinding, trash mobs, and endlessly killing wolves and pigs puts me to sleep fast.  This all ended with the release of The Secret World.  This game throws you into the highly detailed storyline from the start, and it doesn't waste your time with endless grinding.  You can progress through the game at a good pace without the constant repetition of most MMORPG's.  It's not all about killing either, The Secret World breaks up the monotony with lots of puzzle quests, sabotage quests, and other things that will challenge you mentally rather than just make you click your mouse button a few thousand times.<br /><br />I in no means wish to imply that The Secret World is easy.  It isn't.  In fact, The Secret World has some extremely challenging game play from the very start.  Does the game have a couple bugs?  Yes, it is still very new, as of this writing, the game's official release is only 6 days old, but the bugs are few and far between and are fixed very quickly.  I'm having a ton of fun with this one and I haven't been put to sleep yet.
