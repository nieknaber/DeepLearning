This game is extremely fun to play by yourself or with friends. Graphics are great, plenty of kit and vehicle customization options, and some very dynamic maps. If you don't like Battlefield 3, though, there is no need to consider this one. It's essentially a revamped BF3 with a bunch of new maps and guns. Therefore, if you loved BF3, you will absolutely love this game as well! The only fault I see with it is that it launches in a browser window, which works perfectly fine and is easy to navigate, but it just has a strange feeling to it in my opinion. All in all, a great game for those of you who want a shooter that's a bit more realistic than something like Call of Duty.
