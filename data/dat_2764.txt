I don't own this, but it's worth pointing out that this download/purchase is NOT the game. This does not mean it's a bad purchase, but consumers need to understand what they're getting. SOCOM 3 uses a system that requires you to register your copy online for multiplayer purposes, etc. In other words, this download issues a new copy ID for people who bought the game used or traded it with a friend and need their own login information. So, while you may instinctively think $19.99 means you're getting a code for a full game, please be aware before you buy that this item is ONLY an activation code, and you will also need to own SOCOM 3 for it to be of any use.    To summarize:    You do NOT need this if you own a...    1. Retail copy of SOCOM 3 and are the original owner.  2. Pre-owned copy of SOCOM 3 but have no interest (or capability) of playing online against other people.    You DO need this if you own a USED copy of SOCOM 3 and...    1. Want to register to play online using PSP Wi-Fi mode.  2. Want to play local multiplayer using PSP Ad-Hoc mode.    I hope this information helps.
