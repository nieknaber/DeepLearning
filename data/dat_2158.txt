I can't recall the name now, but many years ago I had a toy/game that was like an arena, round tiers  ever smaller, descending to a middle spot. There were grooves in the tiers, and the idea was to line them up so marbles could fall down them, and get to the middle, but without helping your opponent too much. This is a lot like that in two dimensions, and is a lot of fun ... but I've hit a level I just can't seem to get through, and that kind of frustration takes fun away from any game. Perhaps I just haven't tried it enough ... if you're looking for something new and different, this is surely worth a try.
