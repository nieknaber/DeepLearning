i would suggest getting the free preview to this before making any type of a purchase, i tried it and it never would load i tried to change all the settings to anything that i could think of and it would never work, i have windows 7 on my computer and i changed the setting for it to work like i have xp and still nothing, the window would open then it would spazz and close out, and getting the game to even open too a toll as well, so like i said i would suggest that you try to free trial to make sure that its going to work first........
