I'm in my early twenties, but I still didn't play this much as a kid.  I played every now and then on my aunt's SNES, and thought Blanka was pretty sweet.<br />Fast forward to today, and I suck more than any other player.  I suppose this game might not appeal to those younger who are playing it for the first time ever; S/SSIV might be better suited to their needs.<br />The moves can be a bit confusing to master (remember, I'm a newbie), but still prove satisfying when you get a hit.  There aren't any cheap shots, and the new sprites are a big welcome over the original 16-bit ones.<br /><br />It's a great fighter that has lived strong over the years, but for the newbies like me, don't say I didn't warn you.
