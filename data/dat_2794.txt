I love the game but HATE having it go through a Steam account.  In purchasing the downloadable game, you're also creating a Steam account.  Steam to me is a nuisance as I'd rather just load the game itself instead of having to go through a &#34;middle-man&#34; which seems to be the case here.  Also, when starting a mission, the audio cuts out and the game freezes while loading.  This is annoying but I got used to it.
