After reading the great reviews from others I downloaded the game and played for the free 30 minutes to see if I liked it. I do that with any game I think I might be interested in. Anyway, it was a little challenging in the beginning and I like a challenge. I don't want my games to be too easy...where's the fun in that, right? So, after a half hour I decided I'd buy the game. What I didn't realize was after you get going in the game, there's no \\"directions\\" for what you're suppose to be looking for. I spent so much time going around in circles and looking and clicking on everything that I became very confused and frustrated. Granted, I don't want my games to be easy, but I don't want to end up confused or frustrated either. This game reminds me of \\"Myst\\" (remember that one??) because you don't know what you're suppose to do next.     If I could have played this free a little longer I probably wouldn't have bought it. Maybe that's why Amazon only gives you a half hour instead of an hour like Big Fish.    I probably will put this on a disc and file it and get it off my hard drive. No sense in it taking up space when I'm probably not going to play it. Bummer :(
