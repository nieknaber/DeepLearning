I've been playing Outspark games but by far Dark Blood is the best. I think they can sell this game in package at least $20. Great action and animation, 3 hour non-stop playing was so much fun.<br />There are tons of other in game and seems they love this game too.<br /><br />Pro<br />+Graphic and animation : Skill and Effect are dazzling<br />+PVP : Field Duel is so fun and there are battle arena people can go at lv 20(I didn't try this)<br />+Unlimited quests : I can't believe this is a free 2 play game.<br />+Free : Not like other free2play but in fact you need to pay to play it fully, you don't need to spend a penny in this game. So good.<br /><br />Con<br />-2D : Looks 3D but 2D<br />- Big Client size : 2GB<br />- 2nd password : A bit annoying..<br />- Gold spammers : Annoying..<br /><br />I think Dark Blood is going to be the best free to play game pretty soon!
