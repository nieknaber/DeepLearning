I had high hopes for this game, but it is horribly bugged. I can't get past the start of the second battle of the first turn before it crashes my OS. I can't comment on much else about the game since I haven't been able to progress any further.<br /><br />Regarding the Ubsoft game launcher, I found it annoying and prefer to play the game in an off-line mode. One tip I found to play the game in offline mode right away without going through the Ubsoft game launcher was to:<br />1.  Create a short cut to \\"Might & Magic Heroes VI.exe\\"<br />2.  Edit the properties of the shortcut<br />3.  Add to the Target: /offline<br />4.  The result should read something like: \\"C:\Program Files (x86)\Ubisoft\Might & Magic Heroes VI\Might & Magic Heroes VI.exe\\" /offline<br /><br />Fortunately I only paid $7.49,... which is still $7.48 too much.
