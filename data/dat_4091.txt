Note: Amazon gives you an in-game key.  As such, it will work regardless of where you bought the original Anno, be it the Ubishop, Steam, or retail (And thank goodness for doing that)<br />The first thing to remember with Anno is that it is a great time-waster (and not necessarily in a bad way).  Creating the ideal continuous world can take over 40 hours.  As such, this addon can easily take 60 hours or so just by convincing you to do a few of the scenarios and two continuous games.<br />HOWEVER:  This really is not a full-blown expansion; it is just an addon as the name states.  It adds a short campaign, but all that really means is a few pre-set maps.  It adds a total of about 4 new production chains and maybe 15 real buildings (most of them are just ornamental).  But that is really all you get.  While it might plus the game by adding a cool new wonder, there really isn't that much new or revolutionary.  There aren't even any new technologies other than those for the new energy production and transfer buildings and the 2 new units.<br />As such, I can't really recommend an add-on for $30 (I picked it up with a 25% off coupon).  If it goes on sale, maybe pick it up if you liked the original.  There just is not enough material to validate the full price.
