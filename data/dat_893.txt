Not sure why this game got panned by game critics and a segment of DS fans - I thought it rocked.  DS2 was a better storytelling experience (Isaac showed more emotional depth than in first game, and Ellie was badass and really really hot), but DS3 was a lot more fun to play and still had lots of jump scares and horror elements, plus the weapons crafting was pretty awesome.  My biggest complaints about this third game was (1) they made Ellie uglier... BY A LOT.  WTF, she was perfect in DS2, even if she only had one eye!  (2) they made Isaac look like... i dunno, a herb? i guess if you're gonna make Ellie look uglier, makes sense for Isaac to look herbier too.  (3) stupid of them for making a 2 hour DLC that continues the story as a DLC.  Nice try EA, but I just watched the playthru of the game on youtube rather than give you my money.
