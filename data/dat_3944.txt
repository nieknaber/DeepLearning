First off, always online DRM. Something that, despite their urging, is NOT needed. Given this did not exist, I feel the game would be a much better experience then it is now.<br /><br />That being said, the game itself is steps behind its previous incarnations. It lacks many features that made the games great (which I assume will be added later). The game itself has many AI issues that can boggle the game down and have left be frustrated in many cases when needless problems seemed to be occurring. Traffic in particular can be horrible, no matter HOW MUCH you do to alleviate it from buses to street cars. You will still have it bogging down everything as the AI derps around quite a lot.<br /><br />Over-all, it does provide a nice graphical update and does look prettier, though it loses quite a lot of features and has many issues with its AI that just holds the game down. With many rather sad 'advertisement DLC' being tossed in its not something I can really recommend fully with its always on DRM. If your really into Simcity, play the older ones. If your a newer player and your find with it, try it out. Its not a terrible game though it is flawed.
