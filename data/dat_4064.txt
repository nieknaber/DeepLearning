While I'd like to say that when the amazon game download store opened with three or four free games I thought they'd be junk. I was wrong. I've only played this one so far and it probably sucked me in for a good 6 to 8 hours of total game play. The levels get progressively more difficult to the point that the last one is just a little absurd.     Overall it's definitely fun but maddening.
