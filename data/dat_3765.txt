It is not a very technical game. The cities are ridiculously small and there aren't very many layers to the game. I bought it for $40 and feel this is 4 years behind its time. I really couldn't suggest anyone buy this. I watched a lot of video reviews before purchasing this and I must say the game play is way worse than expected.
