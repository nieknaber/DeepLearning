The story is great but like the collectors edition I bought on cd, It crashes so bad on my xp machine that it feels like I'm using windows 3.1 again. I believe the issue is with my video card, which has had all the latest updates, e-GeForce 7600 GT.<br />I fixed this problem before by downloading the version sold here with the Samatha Swift Foutains Of Fate game.  But no luck with this one.  Believe me when I say I've tried everything.  To bad I had to keep rebooting my system just to play this game to its finish.  Thats how good it is but, If I run into this issue again I'm not going to bother buying another version of the same flaued product.<br />Such a shame!
