BEATIFUL SERIES OF GAMES FROM UBISOFT. ONLY PROBLEM IS YOU CAN'T CONTROL WHAT IT DOWNLOADS, MODIFIES, RECORDS PRIVATE INFORMATION AND LEAVES A BACK DOOR BROWSER ACCESS OPEN. YOU CANNOT PLAY THE GAME WITHOUT BEING ONLINE. EXTREMELY HARD TO DELETE AS IT LEAVES IT'S SPYWARE BEHIND. AFTER YOU DELETE IT WITH CONTROL PANEL IT STILL LEAVES A SIZEABLE REMNENT HIDING. TRY TO DELETE A FILE AND THE COMPUTER SHUTS DOWN.<br />OTHER THAN THAT IT IS A BEAUTIFUL GAME. CHECK THINGS OUT FOR YOURSELF ONELINE FIRST BEFORE BUYING.
