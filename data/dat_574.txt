I love the older Max Payne games, but Max Payne 3 is strange and not like the first two. One can see the reviews for 3 and see what they have to say. I reflect that sentiment. But since this is for the whole pack, I'm glad to see that Amazon has put this together. The original is so classic, I love the Bullet Time system and fighting style.
