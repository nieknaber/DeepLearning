Brush up on your European/British spelling.The game uses it to me it made it charming to my wife she was lost for a while(couldn't figure out what a tyre was). Over all found it to be challenging but not too difficult.I took just over 3 hrs wife about 4. Recommend for all Agatha Christie novel fans.
