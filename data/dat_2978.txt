The price for this bundle was so ridiculously low, I think it would be basically impossible to be disappointed with it. For Deus Ex or Just cause alone it would be totally worth it but throw in Supreme commander and Hitman and the Last Remnant and I couldn't say no even though I know i won't have time to play these games at least until next year. Ended up gifting Just Cause 2 to my brother which was great on his high end PC.<br /><br />Buy this pack even if you are only interested in 2 of the games, still value for money.
