This was a very fun game to play, good graphics and interesting story, but I absolutely hate that the game stopped half way through.  I don't mind, if they are intending to have sequels in the future, but what I do mind, very much is the fact that you cannot replay this game.  If this is a one time only game, it should be stated clearly before people purchase it.  I have been playing games for years now, and I have never run across a game that you could only play one time.  That is crazy! But, when you try to play this game again, a screen comes up telling you that you have passed the first part of this game, but you can \\"visit\\" your trophy room to view the cards and trophies you collected throughout the game.  I hope this is not going to be a common practice of downloaded games, because I will not be buying any downloaded games in the future then.  If you can't replay a game if you want to, it isn't worth the money it costs, no matter how cheap it may be.
