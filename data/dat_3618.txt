This is definitely one of the best strategy games of all time. It has a riveting story line, a wide variety of missions, and plenty (but not too many) different kinds of units. I love that you just focus on the mission without having to gather resources, build facilities, and conduct other non-combat functions that bog down so many other strategy games. I also love the rotating camera zoom functions. And the graphics are still outrageously good even today.
