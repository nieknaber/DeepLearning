I downloaded it and I couldn't get the copy to work!! Your tech support kept telling me to do stuff that I had already done and it still didn't work and I was told no refund for the download ridiculous!!! So I ended up downloading a torrent copy of the game that worked and it was legal to do so since I already paid for a copy of the game that didn't work from you guys!!!!
