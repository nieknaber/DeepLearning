I'm not a big fan of stealth games, but this one is extremely fun. You can still play the game as a shooter, but I had a good time playing stealth-only. Great story, amazing soundtrack, and excellent gameplay. The boss battles are the worst part of the game, since they emphasize certain skills that you might not choose to spend very many skill points on.
