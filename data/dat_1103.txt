It's okay and decent enough for killing time. The ability to click on specific parts of the face and mold them is nice but you can't do that to the rest of the body, only the head, and you can't make things shorter or taller, just wider or thinner. It's a little frustrating. Also, the skin tones are weird. If you are using the skin tones that are lighter or slightly tan, then the skin color looks fine. However, if you want to make a sim with black skin or even a kinda dark tan, it has a really gray tone to it and the sim looks a bit dead. Aside from making the sims body and color palette, the variety of clothing is also limited. There isn't a color wheel in this demo. The clothes have a set variety of colors and you can only choose one of their options. So if a shirt/jacket combo only comes in red jacket white shirt or black jacket blue shirt, then those are your only options. I wanted to buy this game initially and I'm glad I waited to play the demo before spending $70+ on a game like this.
