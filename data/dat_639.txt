I'm not generally a fan of platformers, but Adventures of Shuggy is so well executed it's made me into a fan! While there are occasional frustrations for someone with such meager platformer skills such as myself, an inability to finish a puzzle doesn't prevent you from moving forward in the game. It's a great way to allow players to progress when they encounter a level that's got them stumped. I never needed to look up any walkthroughs to get through any levels -- if there was a level I had problems with, I just came back later, and more often than not solved it the second time around. There's a great satisfaction to being able to solve things on your own and not needing to resort to outside help!<br /><br />If you like platformers, and even if you don't, give Shuggy a try. It's an amazing game for the price. I've more than gotten my money's worth, over ten hours playtime at this point, and I'm still working at improving my times. You'll probably get less play time out of it if you're good at platformers, but the game has a lot of appealing features that will make it worthwhile to platformer fans, I think.
