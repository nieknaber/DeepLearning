I really love this cute futuristic game and the music is wonderful. When my 8 year old grandson comes over, we can play this together, as it is very wholesome.<br />I really enjoyed Myst and although this game is really nothing like it, it does offer plenty of challenging puzzles along with resolutions, should one become too stuck.<br />My only gripe is that I wish it would have taken a bit longer to solve but it is well worth the money.<br />I suggest this game for any child over 8 and anyone younger than 108.
