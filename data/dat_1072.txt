Downloaded and installed smoothly, entered all codes and such.  As soon as I launch the game and it switches to full screen, I experience nothing but audio.  My desktop is still there, even though I'm in the application.  My cursor changes, and I hear what sounds like a cinematic or something, but nothing is there.  Very upset, cannot find a way to get support.
