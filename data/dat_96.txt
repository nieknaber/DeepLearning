This was a neat, rather suspenseful DLC for Heavy Rain. It blends in with the same theme of the original game. Even though it's suspenseful, it is quite lackluster. With the A, B, C, D choices this game has, the DLC is more simply just A or B. Sadly, this A or B is just dead or alive pretty much. There are multiple endings, but the general outcome is always the same as above, live or die.<br /><br />It's very late, but nevertheless something that needs to be noted is that David Cage of Quantic Dreams decided *not* to make anymore DLC related to this game, because he felt it would be better to just focus on an entirely new project (which is now Beyond: Two Souls).<br /><br />$5 is a lot for this, but I thoroughly enjoyed Heavy Rain and just wanted to play more of it, hence my reason of buying it (also the fact that I thought more chapters would follow). I can't say don't get it because it's $5, but if you don't care to play a few more minutes of new Heavy  Rain material, then you can skip this. If you do, then go ahead and pick it up. It's about 10~15 minutes, with up to another 10~15 minutes of re-playability. It's not memorable, but it's still a part of the Heavy Rain universe!
