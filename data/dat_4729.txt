Vampire the Masquerade Bloodlines is one of the true cult classics of PC gaming. The studio that made it never got to do anything else and the thing is unplayable unless you go look up the fan patch, but with a little bit of work put in it is a great RPG.<br /><br />One of the best things this game does is getting the player into the old World of Darkness setting with amazing efficiency. It starts you out with no clue what the hell is going on but manages to, by the end of the game, have you run afoul of vampire mystics, a golem, a werewolf, a wereshark, religious zealots bent on killing vampires, far eastern spirits who come off as vampires, and a 400 year old vampire who I still think is actually some kind of alternate universe form of Bender from Futurama in all the best ways.<br /><br />The best part is that all of this stuff manages to happen but the game never feels like it is an exposition dump. As the player you are eased into the weirdness relatively slowly at first, and it is not until you have done quiet a bit of the main quest that you run into this weirdness, by which point some of it has been hinted at.<br /><br />For example, the werewolves are alluded to on two occasions before you come anywhere close to meeting them, same with the far eastern spirits. So while you are working out what to do about the current plot of you having to blow up some building or help sort out a sibling rivalry seeds are being planted of some new element of the story.
