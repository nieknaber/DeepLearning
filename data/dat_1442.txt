I have been a hardcore console gamer since 2005; however, since the announcement of the upcoming next-gen consoles, I've decided to go back to PC gaming. I really enjoy playing Battlefield 4 on my PC and it runs extremely well with my GeForce GTX 770. I rated the game 4-Stars since there are so many issues with the game right now. It constantly crashes and there are some issues with the sound on some maps. Dice is working to fix these issues, but until they are fixed, I'm keeping it at 4-Stars. All in all, BEST GAME I'VE EVER PLAYED!
