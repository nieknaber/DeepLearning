I tried downloading this game after I bought it from Amazon, however after it would fully download it would not run. After two download attempts I called Amazon and they said they would have their techs get back to me. That was about 3 weeks ago. No reply or anything. I am extremely dissatisfied! I ended up buying the game from the app store, quick and painless download and it runs great. If youre running a mac, I highly recommend you just download it from the app store rather than through Amazon!
