pretty scary at first but then after a while you've just been crouching, sneaking, hiding, running, and avoiding interaction with any other characters that it gets pretty mundane and you just want it to end.  Could've been really awesome, there are some really freaky, scary, great idea/original parts that you'll really like BUT it gets to be too much of the same thing after a while and it doesn't matter how creative it is.  If you haven't bought it yet, I'd recommend waiting until its a $5.00 buy, that's what its worth.
