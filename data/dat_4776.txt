The best part of the game is the opening cinematic. After that, it's a mess. The game isn't at all interesting. It overdoes the weird to the point where it's trite. The game engine is slower than molasses on a cold day. I bought it on CDROM and I very much regret the trade. Civilization: Beyond Earth should have been a better game than this. It feels like a complete rip-off.
