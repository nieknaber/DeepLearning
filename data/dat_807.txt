I am far from an expert gamer and I must reveal that I am probably too old to be doing this but I enjoy gameing too much to quit. I played Crysis 1 and found it to be too glitchy to tolerate but I liked the overall idea of it. I had to abandon it mid-game because it hung up and would not advance to the next level no matter what I tried. So when crysis 2 came out with improvements in the game engine I downloaded it to my PC and it definitely played more smoothly. I leave it to more sophisticated gamers to comment on the graphics etc. What I especially dislike about it is the inability to save whenever you like. This requires you to play to the next save point and if you die before that you have to start the segment over from the beginning. I wound up repeating the same thing over and over again in certain more difficult sections which becomes incrediably boring. The other thing I don't like is the repititious nature of the action. This also becomes boring. Also the main story line could be a little more imaginative.
