The game will install on a low end gaming system running windows, however if you do not have a medium to high end video card and a good internet connection this game will simply not play. The game is also very new and there is several  windows errors that plagued me,  when this error comes up it forces you to close the program.  not a fun game to play, the nearly constant error messages and disconnects, the game in my opinion is not ready for deployment to the public.<br /><br />I rated it a 3 for this reason, the graphics are very nice. If you have a high end gaming computer this game could be one of the best games for MMO's, if you can get past the errors.
