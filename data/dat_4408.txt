A solid game throughout. Definitely in the same vane as the Fable series with a healthy does of MMORPG (WoW, etc.) thrown in. It does get a tad tedious at times and there are a lot of reused areas (basically every single dungeon, cave, tree hollow) but that is to be expected in an MMO style game. In all, there is a lot to like about KoA, but not a ton to remember. If anything, the DLC packages are way more memorable than the main game.
