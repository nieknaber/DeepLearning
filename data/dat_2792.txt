As someone who has played FFXI since it's PS2 NA release (on PS2, then 360, then PC), I have to say this has been the most uninspired expansion introduced to FFXI.  I wasn't expecting anything mind-blowing by any means, but the content is terribly archaic.  It's sad to me that the two new job quests were probably the two easiest & least interesting (lore AND gameplay-wise).  Even the original vanilla advanced jobs (BST, BRD, etc) had more thought put into them than the Geomancer or Rune Fencer quests.<br /><br />FFXI has gone further down the zerg-fest route which is great for optimal melee damage-dealer players but leaves no room for real challenges or strategies.  At least Voidwatch & Abyssea included gimmicks (basically, procs) to keep some jobs relevant that would otherwise be useless & completely ignored by the playerbase.  I've done reives (mind-numbingly boring), skirmishes (fun, which is negated by its high barrier to entry & the fact it's already become dead content), all 3 Naakuals (exciting at first, but after spending 5+hrs on each, I have no desire to ever fight one again), & most of Delve (total zerg fest).<br /><br />In their official forum posts, the dev team comes off as panicked, clueless, and unprofessional.  I honestly don't believe they have a strong grasp (or even a basic understanding...) of FFXI's mechanics or even MMO's in general.
