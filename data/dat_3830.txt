NEVER GO DIGITAL!<br />This is the first time I tried the digital download for a playstation gift card. I checked out paid by credit card and got the 12 digit code. I thought it was easy enough until I tried to redeem the code. After I entered the code I got a message saying that this code is already used!!!!! Unbelievable!! I called amazon customer service which was NO help at all. They just deflected me to call sony about my problem. So I'm currently on a 45 minute hold right now with sony to talk to someone about. Do yourself a favor and just go to the store and get a gift card. This is the worst experience!!!
