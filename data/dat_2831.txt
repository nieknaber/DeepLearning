This game took about three hours to play.  I enjoyed the concept of the game (CSI style investigation) and the story of the unsolved murder was interesting.  However, the mini-games were really simple and the hidden object scenes were very repetitive.  They used many of the same locations over and over -- so much that I knew where more than half the hidden objects were right off the bat by the end of the game.  It's a good game for a beginner, but seasoned HOG fans will be bored and want more of a challenge.  Some of the scenes are a little graphic and it's probably not appropriate for pre-teens.
