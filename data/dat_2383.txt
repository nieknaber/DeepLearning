Unfortunately I like this game.  This is unfortunate because the delivery system through the Steam connection only works once in a while.  If the game were no good then I wouldn't care as much that I can't access it.  You know it is funny - I paid for a product without any interest whatsoever in joining some stupid &#34;community&#34; or being exposed to more products, deals, etc. - just wanted the product I purchased which, because of the apparent fragility of the Steam network I am not getting - and yet I would put up with the marketing, the &#34;community&#34; the inane &#34;trading cards&#34; all of the puerile marketing based hoo-ha if I could just access the product I paid for - imagine that!  So, unless you can get this game some way other than through Steam - DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!
