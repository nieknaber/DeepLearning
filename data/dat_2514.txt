I played SimCity (2013) on release, and again recently with the Complete Edition. Most of the major issues have been resolved (namely, online only play, server problems, traffic/agent bugs, and a few other problems). The only major problem left is city sizes, and that unfortunately is a &#34;biggy&#34; as that is the entire core of the game. Once you run out of space you essentially have to start again from scratch.<br /><br />If you play SimCity I can assure you you'll have fun for at least an hour, maybe two or three. Because that is how long it takes your average player to run out of space. As soon as that happens the fun falls off of a cliff, and it turns into a game of &#34;where can I put this?&#34; As you destroy stuff you like to put in stuff you need. The developers claim they tried to resolve this, but the game engine won't support it.<br /><br />The additional content in the Complete Edition is a little bit of fun, but doesn't add a great deal of depth to what is otherwise a fairly easy game. Plus the city size things bites you here too as you struggle to find enough space to have stylised areas within one city, instead often needing entirely separate cities for each theme. I think the expansion pack is the only legitimate additional content you get, the other stuff is just mild fun due to styling (i.e. no gameplay changes).<br /><br />As to if I'd recommend it, the answer is: For what price? Back when the game was full retail price it was an easy &#34;no&#34; (least of all because of the bugs then). Now with most bugs fixed and the game priced at less than a quarter of retail price, it might be worthwhile just for the limited fun you can get out of it.<br /><br />SimCity 4K was likely a game with more depth. However they really have done an incredible job with the graphics in SimCity (2013) and the agent system post-bugs is pretty fun too. In a game like this, I'd love to claim that graphics don't matter, but they honestly do. The attention to detail and animations really do make your city feel more tangible and alive. Going back to 4K or heck even 3K or 2K, makes you feel a little sad.<br /><br />In an ideal world we'd have a game with SimCity (2013)'s graphics, SimCity 4K's depth, and SimCity 2K's difficulty curve (i.e. much harder, but more rewarding).animations really do make your city feel more tangible and alive.
