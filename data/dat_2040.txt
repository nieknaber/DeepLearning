Here are my neatly categorized observations about GRID Autosport (GA).<br /><br />►Controls:<br />Depth of field and blur are mandatory. Blur is an ocular effect, not an environmental effect. Because of this I think one should be able to disable it. I've noticed there are no dead zone options for my Logitec F310 gamepad and I can't adjust the speed of my joystick motion vs steering input.<br /><br />(update) There are several reports of sketchy Logitec G27 support. There are also several reports that a bug from GRID 2 has cropped up in GA concerning steering wheel support.<br /><br />►Physics:<br />As an experiment I took a RWD car to Spa and while doing 120mph on a long curve I gave sudden maximum steering input. This SHOULD result in a sudden loss of grip in the front tires, and send you plowing into a wall by way of understeer. Instead I got oversteer which doesn't make any sense. In terms of physics this game feels like a meld between GRID 1 and GRID 2 or maybe GRID 2 with a bit more grip. Also hitting debris such as broken car parts and cones has little to no effect. :(<br /><br />►Graphics:<br />Nice. Not configurable enough as pointed out earlier. Frame rates are fast on my Nvidia 750ti. However, the graphics feel like a step back from GRID 2. The building models of Chicago look WAY better in GRID 2. Odd.<br /><br />(update) Blur cannot be disabled in the cockpit. IncGamers review of GA speculates that Codemasters have retrofitted all of the car interiors from a free community mod from GRID 2. Also the RPM and speedometer needles don't move. XD<br />(update) The high resolution DLC significantly improves graphics.<br /><br />►Voices:<br />There isn't much variation in teammate chatter. It felt like GRID 1 had a bigger vocabulary. For instance every single race I won in GA had the same &#34;victory message&#34;. The guy literally just says the same thing over and over after each race. Also I don't get chatter from my co-driver guy which is sad.<br /><br />►AI:<br />This is what saves it for me. Each car has a different personality and you get to &#34;know&#34; them in a way. You can count on Raven West to be super aggressive. They will bump you and fight for the line. Conversely I've had guys back down and let me take the pass. There is a lot of bumping but it doesn't seem excessive compared to say... A Need For Speed title. XD<br /><br />(update) On &#34;very hard&#34; difficulty the AI becomes EXTREMELY aggressive. You'll get hit and spun worse than any EA title.<br /><br />►Audio:<br />All good! Love the sounds and where can I buy the soundtrack?<br /><br />►Gameplay:<br />GA is missing a few things that made GRID 1 great. You can't buy and sell cars. The team you join picks your car. They also pick your livery. You never get to build your own team. I liked picking different codrivers in GRID 1, but we'll have none of that in GA. In order to progress in the game you must play ALL disciplines whether you like the discipline or not; which becomes a joykill.<br /><br />►Summary:<br />The game has an extremely rushed feel to it. It feels like a tweaked GRID 2 rather than a whole new game. The races are intense but the game modes aren't motivating. I want to pick my car and build my team like in GRID 1. That would add a lot of motivation I think. Grid Autosport is only slightly better than GRID 2 and no better than GRID 1. If you're tired of GRID1 and looking for something new I'd say buy Need For Speed Shift 2 and wait for GA to go on sale for $10 dollars or so.<br /><br />Thank you for taking the time to read my review. Please push yes or no so I know if its helpful. :)r />►AI:<br />This is what saves it for me. Each car has a different personality and you get to &#34;know&#34; them in a way.
