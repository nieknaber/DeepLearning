Best game in a long time!! Playing through the first level and half way through level 2, this actually feels like im playing the old school Shadow Warrior. Its great! SO much detail and graphics, makes you feel like your right there in the environment! Much to explore, to find secrets to increase your money and karma. I like being able to upgrade your abilities and weapons. I wanna live in this world!
