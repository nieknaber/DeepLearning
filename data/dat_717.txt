Obviously, like, having to buy points from Amazon, then download the file with the game code from Amazon, and /then/ go to Origin/Bioware to apply the game code to get the DLC represents way more acrobatics than should actually be necessary, etc.<br /><br />But the points work just fine and the DLC itself is pretty great.
