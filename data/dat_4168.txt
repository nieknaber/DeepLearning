ok i just downloaded this 3 days ago, and have been playing it non-stop.  Not sure why this game gets bad reviews i love it.  This game gets my heart pumping, those aliens jump out of no where, and make me jump out of my chair.  Some reviews didn't like the 3rd person slash first person view,  i thought it was great.  You have nothing on the screen its just you, no map in the corner, no health indicator, its like you are there. Other people are writing you cant play this on steam it has to be orgin, well i downloaded to my computer installed it and played.  Its not running thur orgin, just my computer.  I think the story is great the action is top notch.  I would recommend this game to anyone.  I dont play my games on hard mode i play on easy or medium.  The graphics are very good, on chapter 10 now and will be downloaded part 2 soon.  For 8 dollars you cant beat this deal.  Now if i could go out and get the neca Isaac Clarke action figure for less than 100 dollars i would be happy.
