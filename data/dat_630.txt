If you aren't looking for Simcity4 and can ignore the online only component to it all it's okay. It gets old pretty quickly but it is what it is. Is it worth buying? Sure but don't waste your money on the more expensive versions. It is enjoyable as long as you didn't suffer through the launch issues.
