This game is great. Orgin is great. No problems running it with origin, no viruses found by Norton Security Software. Where did this rumor come from that says that the game is unplayable and that Origin is spyware? The game it self is really fun! Great story line, great graphics, great gameplay. There are a few tiny, minor bugs that I am sure that will be fixed.
