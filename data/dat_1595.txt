Every one of these games is worth at least the cost of this bundle. For me, I'm paying $12.50 for Magicka (almost half the price of Steam) and still getting FOUR other games for FREE. Honestly, the only reason not to buy this bundle is if you already own each and every game in it.<br /><br />EDIT: At time of writing, the package was a mere $12.50, now that it's over $100, please disregard my previous review. This package \\"deal\\" is now worthless.
