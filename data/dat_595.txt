While you may believe that some of these reviews are quite phony and that Microsoft would never attack your credit card with overwhelming fees, think again. I used my credit card to pay for a subscription Xbox Live fee every three months. When I finally wanted to cancel it, Microsoft made the process difficult and confusing and impossible to do from an Xbox 360. When I called Microsoft they quickly apologized and told me my account would be removed from their system and that my account would expire whenever the current three month chunk ran out. They Lied. At the end of the three month period my account was charged again and Microsoft replied that there was no record of my account being removed from the system and promised to remove it once again. After a week or two I called back and Microsoft verified that my account would not be renewed again. They Lied. Again. At the end of the three months my account was again charged and thanks to my good credit with my Amazon Card, I was able to tell the Amazon Visa people to decline the charge. Of course at the point Microsoft finally deleted my credit card after it &#34;bounced&#34; a payment and my Xbox Live account was not charged again.<br /><br />My advice- buy ONLY these prepaid card and NEVER give Microsoft access to you credit card info!
