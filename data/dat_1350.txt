..but worth it.I just dl'd the game and installed it last night,and found myself  suddenly at level 72!!<br />The game is fun;looks good;the music doesn't drive you bonkers;and most importantly,it is a great stress-buster.Safe and legal.<br />I would recommend this game to everyone,regardless of age.Also,I am a die-hard RPG and FPS gamer,and this little gem of a game didn't bore me for a second.<br />Give it a try.
