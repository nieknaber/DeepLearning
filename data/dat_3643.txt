Risen is a simple, entertaining RPG.  A lot of people don't like the combat but combat shouldn't be the reason you bought an RPG.  The story isn't captivating, but keeps you coming back.  The environment is nice to look at and fun to explore.  I like RPG's when the enemy doesn't level up with you.  There are some tough enemies early in the game, so you have to come back later in the game.  Makes the experience more realistic IMO.
