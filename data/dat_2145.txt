When you think of poker you usually think of a game where you are sitting around with your friends trying to outsmart each other and having a good time with great conversation. The folks over at Tell Tale Games decided to release their first masterpiece which was Poker Night at the Inventory. You took on the role as the player entering into a high stakes poker tournament as you tried to be the last one standing. Now Tell Tale Games has released a sequel to this great game called Poker Night at the Inventory 2 but is this a game you want to spend your chips on?<br /><br />This game takes place at the same location which is the inventory as you have four new players you need to compete against. Sam the other half of the Sam and Max franchise makes his debut in this game as well as Brock from Venture Brothers, Claptrap from the Borderlands Universe and the most surprising Ash from the Evil Dead movies. Each of these characters has witty dialogue, great facial expressions and some funny animations as they are eliminated from play. Also another character GlaDOS appears from time to time to announce the blinds and to heckle you as well. There are two modes of play as you can play Texas Hold `em or Omaha but if you're new to this stick with Texas Hold `em as the latter is a bit harder to pick up.<br /><br />The AI in this game is pretty good and you will be swearing that these AI are cheating but you need to beat all four of these characters not just for bragging rights. Each of these characters has various unlocks for other games / features on other consoles. I bought this game on the PC and there are not only 4 unlocks for Team Fortress 2 but four skins for Borderlands 2 as well! But beating these guys is no easy feat as you will think you have a great hand only to get trumped by a straight or a flush that one of the computer players has.<br /><br />One of the best features of this game has to be the price as it can be had for as little as $4.99 on steam! That is a deal in and of itself for this fun , witty and one of the best poker games out on the market todayin and of itself for this fun , witty and one of the best poker games out on the market today
