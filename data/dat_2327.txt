This is my introduction to the Far Cry series with the PC download from Amazon.  After a problem-free download, I was instantly immersed in the game and spent many hours engaged in the various missions of Jason Brody, our young protagonist who's vacation in Bangkok and the Rook Islands has taken a horrible turn for the worse! A couple of points worth noting--1> you can occupy your time achieving new items crafted or unlocked, or you can just explore the incredible graphic detail of the island and just goof around. 2> The more skills you collect, the bigger the detail of the tattoo on your (Jason's) arm! 3> The save feature can be annoying as you are sometimes forced to go all the way back to the beginning of a tedious adventure if you fail. Overall---Five Stars. I am looking forward to the new Far Cry 4......Stay tuned for more.
