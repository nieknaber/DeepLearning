I'm someone who defends Doom 3 still today. It's not a perfect game, and it's not exactly like the original two, but it's a solid horror shooter with great style, mood and combat. Unfortunately the &#34;BFG Edition&#34; is a step back in most ways, worse than the original game on PC.<br /><br />First off the lighting changes are for the worse. Everything is brighter, but Doom 3 is meant to be dark. The textures look worse under harsh lighting and the mood of each level is thrown off considerably. Even on a gameplay level this matters, since many ammo clips and armor packs were previously hidden in darkness, but now stand right out. The flashlight, long a thing people have complained about needing to switch to, can now be on permanently, but this ruins a lot of the level design and mood of the game. To be blunt: this game and these levels were not meant to be seen under bright lights, and the gameplay is thrown off by the changes as well as the visuals.<br /><br />Other changes annoy. Quicksaves now pause the action and pop up a menu prompt, which throws off the pace and takes you out of the game. The in game touch screens seem less fluid for some reason, and the PDA is now designed more for a gamepad than a mouse. On top of this the game takes a lot more HDD space, a lot more GPU power and has less ability for tweaking, which will annoy if you want to play it on an older machine or laptop.<br /><br />The only reason to get this on PC is for the &#34;lost levels,&#34; eight additional levels exclusive to this release. The problem here is that Doom 3 and its original expansion are already so long and packed with content you don't really need any more, and these added levels look identical to the main game and play worse, since they aren't as well designed. Just not worth the effort, let alone the money.<br /><br />I knew the BFG edition wasn't perfect, but I didn't expect it to be worse than playing the original. That makes it worse than a pointless release, it makes it a damaging release.it a damaging release.
