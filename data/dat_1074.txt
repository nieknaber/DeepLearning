I really enjoyed this game except the fact that after playing the free trial for 30 minutes and then buying the game, I was done in like 2 hours. I am very upset I paid for a game that was so short. I mean I've played other seek and find games on TV network websites that are free that were harder and took me longer to do than this. Very disappointed.
