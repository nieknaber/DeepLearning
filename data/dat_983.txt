I have bought Microsoft points off of Amazon many times and every time I have had a good experience. Most of the time the code shows up on the screen right after I make the purchase, but one time it did take waiting for the email to show up. That only took less than 10 minutes.<br /><br />If you are having problems redeeming your code it could be a few things...<br /><br />1) Try redeeming it again. If its invalid it will say its invalid, but 99.9% of the time it is valid and its something else.<br />2) If there is any other error message, PAY ATTENTION TO IT. It means there is an account related issue that needs to be addressed like an outstanding renewing subscription balance for xbox live or an account lock that is preventing you from redeeming any prepaid codes or making any purchases on the marketplace.<br />3) Call xbox support (1-800-4 MY XBOX) and they can run the code and make sure it is valid. They however can NOT replace codes, that is Amazon's job if there is in fact something wrong with the code. They can at least tell you the status though and if there is an account related issue that is preventing you from redeeming the code.<br /><br />I bet you 90% of the negative reviews on here are account related issues and nothing else. I hope this helps!
