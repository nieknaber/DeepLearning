I made some youtube videos here: [youtube.com/user/GamingTaylor]<br /><br />I must say..I had high hopes for this game as Red Alert 2 was a childhood favorite. Playing Red Alert 2 is still great, acting, gameplay, missions, everything was about building a big force and crushing the enemy with power.<br /><br />This game however....is a bit different....<br /><br />At first it was enjoyable as I enjoyed the humor with the tutorial, and the beginning cinematic was quite interesting.<br /><br />Even the graphics were pretty well made, although I may see why people wouldn't like the vibrant colors, and the small selection of units which does make the game feel \\"childish\\"<br /><br />The acting...is not great...definitely not anything compared to Red Alert 2, characters don't fit with the story, and the story is very odd. It begins with going back in time, killing Einstein, then coming back to the future and facing the \\"Empire of the Rising Sun\\" and the Allies...not only this, a heavy influence is put on every female model by showing their cleavage...I think this is in reference to Tanya in Red Alert 2, but she definitely did not look like a porn star (like some of these actors)<br /><br />The maps...are strange...the second mission you are fighting at a carnival...why? what? war? at a carnival? You even see soldiers playing games, and you release the \\"bears\\" from the cages...so odd<br /><br />The biggest point however is the gameplay...<br /><br />1) A huge influence was put on building both land and sea...I'm not sure why...and most units can \\"transform\\" between navel and land or be on transports.<br />-In my opinion it makes the game very slow, and difficult to get troops \\"into\\" the battle.<br /><br />2) Instead of building up an army you are instead supposed to build a small amount of various types, and use the strategy in their \\"abilities\\" and your \\"special powers\\" to complete the objective. Makes the game very slow paced, and often you feel like all the units are just weak.<br /><br />3) Harvesting Ore has returned, but this time all you do is build 1 or two, and your done...basically taking the whole concept of resource collection, and throwing it out...<br /><br />4) What really ruins the game for me is this \\"co-commander\\" business. They seemed to have made each mission \\"co-op\\" so you can play together with a friend online. HOWEVER, is you choose solo you get an AI to take their place, and this AI typically does everything for you....even in the second mission, they give the AI the \\"super unit\\" while you are stuck with some spider bots....sort of silly...<br /><br />5) Very unbalanced...there's this huge gap in units....sometimes randomly a larger unit will appear and just wipe your entire army out, and you won't have much to defend, or....to kill it, you'll have to sacrifice your entire army.<br /><br />Overall...even though I've only played about 4 missions + the tutorial...it's sad. By the time  you reach the 4th mission there will be like 4 different colored units on the screen, and you'll be in a base completely in the water, and it's sooooo difficult to get on land, because the enemies will keep attacking, and you always have low income because you only get two harvesters in like every mission which can't be expanded. (YES YOU CAN NOT EXPAND YOUR RESOURCE COLLECTION) Why? I have no idea....even in starcraft...resource collecting was a main strategy, now it's lost.<br /><br />It \\"Seems\\" like the makers of this game wanted you to use strategy with units instead of building up your base/army, but it's very slow paced, and lacking in so many ways from Red Alert 2...making it boring...uninteresting...and childish. (Perhaps it \\"was\\" made for a younger audience) I'm not entirely sure...but it's definitely not anything special. if you look my youtube channel you'll see like the difference between the beginning of Red Alert 2, and Red Alert 3 (made videos of both).  Sure Red Alert 3 has nicer graphics...(a bit too vibrant/cartoon looking), but Red Alert 2 gives you so much more freedom, and actually challenges you in a fast paced environment a lot more like Starcraft.<br /><br />Rating: ★★ / ★★★★★ (Not Great...but is a bit of fun for ~$5) (I paid $17 for the complete C&C collection for Windows 7, so basically $5 or less..haha)
