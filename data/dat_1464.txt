If you love hearing your children laugh out loud while spending time together, then I highly recommend getting this game! My daughter and son proclaimed &#34;Lord of the Rings&#34; the best of the movie-inspired LEGO games, and it provided them with hours of fun. With so many wonderful characters and so much compelling drama in the novels and movies to depict and parody, &#34;Lord of the Rings&#34; is the perfect epic for the LEGO treatment. Actual dialogue clips from the movies enhance the action, improvements in access to the map, and side quests that extend play are just some of the new features that enrich this clever game.
