It's uncanny seeing how American this game is which was made by a group of Czech developers. It is very authentically American, reminding me a lot of the city of Pittsburgh with the freeways surrounding the city and the Italian flags on townhomes. When you drive, you will hear familiar tunes that you haven't heard in years and can't quite name.<br /><br />The detail is phenomenal. Walk into a bar and it really looks like a bar that you might have a drink in. It isn't a rush job like how GTA 4's interior's felt. It feels like the developers spent a significant amount of time crafting it, and it really shows. It feels like an American bar. Same for the other stores. You actually see other customers in these places doing their own thing.<br /><br />The game was so realistic that I found myself actually following the rules. The world was so authentic that I felt that it would be wrong to wage destruction on the citizens. So I stop at stoplights and I follow the speed limit. When I broke the speed limit, the cops pulled me over and I paid a fine. In the beginning, you see the protagonist Vito praying with his mother. How many games do this?<br /><br />Contrast this with GTA which is cynical to the core of it, down to like skipping out of a hospital completely healed up and still holding guns after murdering dozens of people on the street. GTA 4 is a game which I just cannot get myself to finish.<br /><br />I'm careful with my car because it costs money to repair the car. So I follow the rules of the world. There are more rules that are followed. I actually honk my horn at rude drivers. One driver side-swiped me and I got out in a fit of road rage. HOW DARE HE SIDE-SWIPE MY VIRTUAL CAR. Then I pulled out my gun but he shot me first.<br /><br />All of this makes for an incredibly immersive game world, because you really do have to act like a good citizen, much more so than other games.<br /><br />The games graphics are pretty good. They are on a whole better than GTA or Assassin's Creed graphics, while giving better detail in the character faces and animations, and populating the streets with a healthy number of people (more than you see in real life, actually). The PhysX makes for nice little touches that make the game more immersive like better flowing clothes.<br /><br />The AI is extremely good. For instance, in one mission, I'm sneaking around a building. I go in a room and I leave the door open. The guard sees the open door and walks in the room. I die.<br /><br />So next time around, I have to remember to keep doors closed while sneaking. Even stealth games like Splinter Cell don't have AI behavior this advanced. and speaking of doors, the game world makes me actually want to be a good citizen and close the door of my car or of the store I just exited.<br /><br />Another nice thing is that the game levels don't lead you around by the nose. They let you discover things yourself. For instance, in a level where I'm tasked with stealing some stamps they tell you about getting the key and opening a safe.<br /><br />What they don't tell you is that there's an alarm system tied to the safe. You have to discover this for yourself and disable it yourself.<br /><br />Might take multiple playthroughs, but is pretty neat. You have to really plan it out for yourself. There's no \\"hit A, B, and C\\" which I feel a lot of games end up doing.<br /><br />Now, there is a fair amount of tedium in this game, from driving around the freeways. I like this as it makes you feel like a regular guy driving his car around to the job -- like real life. You also get a chance to listen to the radio while doing this. Game reviewers and Call of Duty-heads don't really like it, but to me it just adds some more to the immersion.<br /><br />Amazing.
