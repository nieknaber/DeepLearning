Let me just say I loved the first two blockbuster Arkham games but this one was much better! At least on the PC...<br /><br />I played this on the PS3 first, the controls weren't as responsive as the first two so I gave it up quick. Then I decided to give the PC version a go after purchasing a gaming computer. And needless to say I was surprised at how much better this is for the PC, control wise. The graphics are about the same for me since my gaming rig isn't the best (but pretty darn good!) but graphics aren't everything and aren't what makes this game good. Rather the story, and better voice acting. I understand a lot of people love the previous voice actors (I liked them too) but the new guys and gals weren't to bad, in fact I think they are better a fit for video games. While the previous voice actors are best for animated movies/tv shows, imo.<br /><br />Overall the controls are about the same, but you get a few new gadgets. And while the gameplay is almost identical there is still something fresh about the story that makes the game worth playing. I recommend starting this game on Easy and working your way up just for replay value, and to unlock stuff. This one will be played, a lot by the time I am done with it!<br /><br />5*****/5*****
