top notch art direction, sound design, soundtrack and pretty much everything<br /><br />the game is a hybridized point and click/ text adventure (don't be fooled by that label, you'll never be without something fascinating to look at, listen to, or interact with).<br /><br />I'll assume you already know something about the premise if you're reading this review, and you're just looking for some feedback to see if all the hype surrounding this game has any substance to it. if not head to cardboard computer's website or any gaming website (ign, gametrailers, gamespot, what-have-you) and read up on it.<br /><br />I'll just say that this game is hypnotic, and I say that in the best possible way. its very well structured in that play sessions are as bite-sized or as long as the player chooses, but the atmosphere is so gripping you'll probably play straight through. its very much worth the price (25$ for all acts in a bundle).<br /><br />if you like games that feature exploration, or if you're an avid reader, chances are you love this game as much as I did.<br /><br />I only have one caveat to share with ya'all: don't play through just once and don't follow the directions characters give you promptly or exactly. this game really rewards you for getting lost on the road and exploring at your leisure. If you just follow the &#34;main story&#34; from point to point, you'll only experience maybe 25% of the game. this is more like a maze than a racetrack.
