I've had a couple of the different Cake Mania titles and enjoyed them all. I find that the game tends to get really tough quick. However, with Main Street, it seems to stay on the easy side longer. It's a good game, but there are a few others I'm enjoying a lot more right now; such as Burger Bustle, Sally's Salon and Jessica's Cupcakes.<br /><br />If you're looking for a truly great time management title, go with Supermarket Mania 2.
