I love hidden object games of all types, but prefer ones that have a mystery type plot to them.  I don't like too many of the &#34;mini-games&#34;, but enough to keep you on your toes.  This one had great graphics and the plot was pretty cool.<br /><br />I would definitely try other games made by this company.
