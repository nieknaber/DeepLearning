Horrible.<br /><br />My computer is pretty comfortably above the minimum requirements and this game is nearly unplayable. And I'm glad to see its not my fault, judging by so many people having similar experiences.<br /><br />I want my money back. If I don't get my money back or have this game actually run, I won't be buying another EA/Origin game.
