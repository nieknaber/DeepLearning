I own this got it on psn for 81 dollars, so saved about 8 which is good. Well alone your paying for the kombat pack which is a season pass but I believe Ed boon is going to give out more dlc so if you buy this your not only getting 15 skins and four iconic characters, which is pretty much worth it. Also were getting the story pack as well.
