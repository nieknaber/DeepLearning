This game is one I'd definitely recommend it to people who are new to games or looking form something for younger players. It's an imaginative game with a lot of heart. And with steam you can download more things to write and create in the game, making it even more explorative.<br /><br />I do wish there was a sandbox area, but it's a very small gripe on the wake.
