This is my first review on Amazon though have been a customer for years; it's in fact my first time trying out the \\"game library\\" contents and guess what, it's simply amazing. I was in a rush to buy Minecraft on Xbox Live therefore tried an order of this. One-click payment, being redirected to a page that had the redeem code (also got an email copy), pasted it into Xbox Live and 1600 points were received, done deal. The whole shopping experience is very simple and smooth. That's the prime reason I love buying stuff on Amazon.
