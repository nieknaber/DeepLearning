The game is over the top fun.  It takes itself very seriously/not seriously at all.  So many parts of the game are obviously just supposed to be fun, and it is.  The upgrading of your abilities and such is enjoyable, there are so many mini-games that even if you dislike half of them, you will not soon grow bored with the other half that are provided.<br /><br />I playyed all the way through and though I don't think it was as good as Sleepings Dogs, I definitely did enjoy it.
