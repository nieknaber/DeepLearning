the only thing that is bugging me is that the audio in the campaign keeps messing up. It sounds perfect in multiplayer, but as soon as i started the campaign the audio got all fuzzy and it sounded like the people were stuttering, and the shots were off sync with the gun every time i shot. It got annoying real fast.
