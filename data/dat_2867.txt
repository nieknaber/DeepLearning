I don't understand why this game didn't get more support from EA.  It's tremendous fun.  Admittedly, I'm more interested in story than challenge, so I'm cheating at it like mad (using Cheat Engine), but still, there's a lot of variety in the action, lots of different weapons, each with their own mechanics and timing to master, blahblahblah.<br /><br />Give it a shot.<br /><br />Oh, and it's true, the thing is huge.  Open world, lots of monster variety, lots of thoroughly engaging side quests, in addition to the also thoroughly engaging main story.  The writing is quite good.
