I helped to fund this on Kickstarter, and boy am I happy with how it turned out.  Incredible graphics, super realistic period voice-acting, environments, attire, weapons, you name it--this is the medieval FPS I'd hoped it would be.  The community can be jerks sometimes, so it's best to mute the in-game chats (in my opinion, at least), so when you take that out of the equation, it's just a great, fun, fast-paced bludgeon-fest in the vein of Monty Python.  The game modes are varied enough to keep things interesting, too.  I just hope the game is supported long-term; with its huge success, the studio is now partnering with bigger fish on another project, but as long as the servers are active and new content continues to roll out (since it's multiplayer-only), this thing is golden, especially for the price.
