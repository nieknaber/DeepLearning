I love the idea of having maps based on real-world locations, so this map pack fulfilled my desires. However, the real gems are the continents plus and pangea plus maps. These maps are excellent, and like their description says, revamps strategic city-state placement and creates island chains for city states. Better than regular continents and pangea any day.
