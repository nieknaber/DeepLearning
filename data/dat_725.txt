As others have mentioned, when running this game on Windows 7, any player profiles that you create vanish as soon as you exit the program. I had the same problem, but this is due to Windows 7 security which doesn't allow you to save anything under the root directory or program folders. The quick and dirty solution is to always open the game in administrator mode (right click on the application icon and you'll see the option to do this) and then check allow this application to make changes to your computer. You'll need to do this every time you open the game if you want to save your game statistics. There may be a permanent way to grant access to this application, and if I find it I will add an update here.<br /><br />Other than that, I'm glad someone has finally released a PC version of this game that runs on Windows 7, even with the saving issue which is an issue with quite a few applications, even some older Microsoft applications. I own the Big Box set of this game, so not having the rules was not an issue, but I did download the English PDF manual from the product details page without any issues.
