This game fixes a lot of little annoyances you encounter in other MMOs - the ability to buy/sell on the market from anywhere (although you have to find a vendor to pick up profits/items purchased), the ability to send/receive mail anywhere, the ability to deposit crafting materials from anywhere into a special bank JUST for crafting materials (with stacks up to 250 - although it is basic stuff you collect, not the items you make beyond the initial conversion of things like ore to bars.  Zones have dynamic leveling - so if you go into an area for characters below your own level, your effective level (stats/damage) drops to the max level for that area while you are there to keep things interesting.  Loot and resource nodes are for each individual, so no fighting over resources or loot.  No 'tagging' a mob - anyone who hits it gets exp and potentially loot.  PvP in specific zones (both 5 on 5 and world vs world (vs world)) so you can choose to level or pvp when you want.<br />  I haven't hit 80 yet, so I'm not sure how the lack of a traditional end-game will be (although I have never been the hard core gamer that needs to do all those raids in other games for gear), but the dynamic level for zones, and the fact that the dungeons (8 total at launch) all have at least 4 variations to them (1 or 2 look to have 5), plus a ton of achievements for those oriented that way (I tend to be) should keep things interesting for a while for that first character.
