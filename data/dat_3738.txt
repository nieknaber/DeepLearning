I just  bought this myself after playing GTA IV again and I wanna help others that have a hard time getting this to work as well as GTA IV. I have Windows 7 ultimate 64 bit, if that matters. I should also mention that when downloading, you need to walk away from the computer until it downloads completely. I did other things the first time while downloading and ended up with a corrupt version. Then I tried again but walked away until the download was complete and it was all good.  First to install it and get it working initially, I set my system time back to 2010 for EFLC and Dec 2008 for GTA IV. It's August now. After it's installed, the 'Release Date check should work. If did for me. After it's installed and all good, you can set your date back to real time.  Next to get it working because the game won't start because of Window games something or other. You have to get xLiveLess and copy the xlive.dll into the GTA IV or EFLC folder. Now the game will start.

You can disable them using this method but you also need to have ScriptHook.dll installed for it to work. Links for both; http://forums.steampowered.com/forums/showthread.php?t=2000065 http://www.gta4-mods.com/tools/gta-iv-net-scripthook-v0893-beta-f2941  Finally, this is the best site for mods and other scripts and things that don't give you bs popups when downloading. www.gta4-mods.com.  You also don't want to use gtainside.com because you'll get those popups saying you have a virus and then you have a hard time closing out the windows.  Hope this helped someone and you get to enjoy the game too. Have fun
