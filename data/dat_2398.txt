The game is great, I knew it would be as we have it foe xbox360 which I can,t get away from my husband, that's why got the computer game version. He has all the assassin creed games. The only problem is the key board control, they are every hard to use as some times you have to press 3 keys at once and where they place like the w and shift and if you have to press another it is hard.<br />It took forever to download. It took me a week. But I do love the game.
