Right now, this is a great deal. You are essentially buying the game for $30 and the Premium add-on. But before you click the Buy and Download button, I want to make a few things clear.<br /><br />This game is graphically fantastic, and while the story itself isn't immersive, it does show what the Frostbite 3 engine can really do. The sounds are amazing and have done a top-noch job of making me feel in the game and part of the experience. There are a ton of new gameplay features that really add on to the Battlefield experience and Levolution is a great way to change the way the map plays. There are more attachments, more customization, and more time playing for something to earn.<br /><br />And there are bugs. Lots of them.<br /><br />Right now, there is an issue with hit detection. They tout it as &#34;Client-side&#34; hit detection, but for some reason, I can empty an entire magazine of 21 rounds on a player and have about 4 hit markers. This is while they are standing still too. Dying behind cover still exists and there were even times when I died running through a cut open fence. No explanation why.<br /><br />So my verdict stands as this: If you want to have it for later this month, or after New Years, this is a great buy. DICE is working on these fixes, and if you look at the history of Battlefield 3, you will see that issues existed in that game as well. So give it time. It will improve.
