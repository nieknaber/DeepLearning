Don't know what this is but it is definitely not Bioshock not part 1 or 2.  Where are the Big daddys and little sisters?  Gone is everything that made Bioshock so popular now we have regular everyday christian people trying to kill you thinking you are the devil reincarnated.  I prefer the deranged splicers and plasmids of part 1, lighting them on fire and seeing them run around screaming. But Infinite is a totally different game from the originals, a different direction so you cannot compare the two at all. The first part of the game is boring but the second part is where the game comes alive where the fighting becomes more intense and bloody especially in hand to hand combat when you run out of ammo. Be prepared for heads to roll and blood to squirt when the fighting starts, it gets really hectic and fun.  Then there is Elizabeth she truly is a work of art in a game almost real, if only the whole game was more like Elizabeth then it would be a 10 out of 10.  She really is part of the game and is your partner in crime.  Her facial expressions are like nothing Iike I have seen before in a game and you can tell when something is bothering her.  Her creation by the game makers deserves an award. Overall the Game is a 9 out of 10 for Elizabeth and the intense fight scenes where you must use a combination of guns and vigors to vanquish your enemies.  it took me awhile to master the guns and vigors so give it time but before I knew it I was commanding killer crows with the stroke of a hand while in the other hand I was blowing things up with the rocket launcher.  They could have done more with the songbird just like the Big Daddy in Bioshock 1.  I also changed the setting to max HD quality for a better experience.  I recommend you get this game.
