It's Sim City, what's not to like?  Fun game, way better than the newer one that's for sure.  The problem is getting this thing to run correctly on Windows 7.  I'm unsure if it is a 64 bit issues or a general Windows 7 issue but the game would constantly crash no matter what \\"fix\\" I applied to it.  So if you are on XP, or plan to play this on XP, buy it up.  Anything later and I wish you luck.
