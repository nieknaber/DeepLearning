I have a Dell PC with Windows Vista which I've had since 2007.  The game download took about 2 hours total, just as advertised.  The gameplay is difficult at first if you're not used to the Sims games, especially keeping up with the eating, sleep, and work schedules since time flies by so fast for the sims.  I enjoy the game, and I am confident that there is a lot of variety to make gameplay interesting.  I look forward to playing it more!
