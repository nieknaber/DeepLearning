This game represents a very chilling example of borderline theft. I paid the not insignificant sum of $60 to purchase this game. There is an understanding between the customer and the vendor that, in exchanged for cash, goods or services will be provided. Yet here I am, writing a review of SimCity instead of playing it, because I cannot do so.<br /><br />Think about it. If you bought a car, you would expect to be able to drive it off the lot, no? You would also expect to be able to drive it around completely, without any restrictions or issues, for the first week (or two weeks, or three weeks) that you owned it. I don't care about EA or Maxis saying that they're working around the clock to fix it...you sold me a lemon.
