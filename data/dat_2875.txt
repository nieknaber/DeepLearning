I only played a little bit of it yesterday but so far I enjoy it.  Not really anything new or different from other games but hey it is still fun. It seems to me that the majority of people bashing this game were expecting another halo or something along those lines. Well this isn't halo so move along. Overall I'm happy with it and I had no issues downloading. Great game if you enjoy fps with some RPG elements.
