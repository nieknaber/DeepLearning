Be aware that the activation instructions are not correct. You have to activate the code in the game (in the Palidin) not in uPlay - this will give you an \\"invalid code\\" error. After trying this a few time I got banned by uPlay for trying to activate an invalid code too many times. After a week of exchanging several messages with uPlay support, they finally told me the correct way to activate the code. I still don't understand why they didn't tell me this right away instead of making go through several days of questioning me and delays of responding to my replies.
