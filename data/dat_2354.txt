The game has improved. New maps, guns, attachments, etc. Battlefield 4  has been on my favorite game, and it will always be, as well as Battlefield 3. There aren't any immature or rude players. Overall I'm static about the new DLC coming soon. So far I'm impressed with the game and the improvements they have made/did. Battlefield 4 will be also more amazing , you play with friends/family. I would recommend this game to everyone.
