This game is one of my favorites and I go back to it often....which I don't do with most of my others. It has hidden objects and also the search where you collect items to use later. What I enjoy the most is the puzzles. You actually use things you have found, and these puzzles are the most unique ones I've seen. They are a bit challenging, but not so hard you have to skip them. The Treasure of Mystery Island 2, The Gates of Fate is EQUALLY as fun and compelling.
