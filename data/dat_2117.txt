I have very little time to play games. But I know i will have time later (if I don't die or something similar). I bought this about a month or so ago and redeemed them on Steam. Even though I haven't played them yet, I figure grabbing it while it was on sale for $20 is a fantastic deal. So I got 3 highly rated games for $20 that I figure will give me hours of future enjoyment.
