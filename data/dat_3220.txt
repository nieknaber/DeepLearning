There are a few things I don't like, for instance the intrusive Orion network which does not close when the game closes...what are you watching guys? I feel like the whole game is spyware that I paid for and I do not care for the fact that it is not a standalone game...but, I knew all this when I bought it.  Being a SimCity fan since v-2 I have to say, I do enjoy the game, again, there are some little quirks I don't like, there is very little help in the game for instance and it seems everything takes up too much space...but overall game play is good, the graphics are great and I am enjoying it in spite of the parts I do not like....I would say that the wonderful graphics are what push it over the edge of liking in spite of the other stuff.
