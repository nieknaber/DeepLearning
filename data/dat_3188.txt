The DLC itself is largely uninteresting. Of the 4 MP maps, Grind is the only one which is actually fun, the rest are a pure waste of your time and money. On the other hand, Grind isn't  exactly a show stopper either. If anything, it's average. While Die Rise is actually awesome, the will to continue playing it decreases over a period of 2-3 weeks tops. I love playing on Town Survival however simplistic it is, but Die Rise gets repetitive, fast. Same story with Turned. Fun for a while, then you'll forget it even exists. I would only recommend buying Revolution if you're a hardcore COD fan, or you will be disappointed.
