Alright, so, for starters I would like to be distracted at this very moment, by actually playing SIMCITY. Instead, that energy is going into a very unfavorable review about the SINGLEPLAYER game I paid $60 for that I cant play... For a while now... Being at the whim of servers for a game I intend on playing by myself is just really annoying and totally unnecessary. Only if I had the option to be online to play with people and the servers were down, oh well, I could just play offline so I can entertain myself and learn the game better and the issue would be irritating, but not really annoying. But, I guess taking my money and insisting I be online so my ISP can be used to try to sell me more crap is more important to EA. Yep, that's very very annoying.    On the subject of annoying, so is the fact that it took TEN years for another Sim City release. Why? So EA could milk every puppy it could out of the voyeuristic bore that is The Sims. Yes, that game was as dumb as it was creepy. The novelty wore off fast after the first time you made your Sim swim laps in the pool and take the latter out so you could witness the Sim pee itself and cry.    For a game title you love return after a ten year absence an expectation is born. One expectation is not to pay EA $60 to beta test it for them and go through their growing pains. I tried the open beta a month back, I didn't get a real feel for the game, or report any bugs because you only got one hour into a game before you got kicked off. On top of that most buildings and options were not available.    Last night I was able to play in the wee hours and let me tell you, This game is not finished. The camera angles and side scrolling are clunky at best, which makes the control panel annoying to use because the buttons are so close to the edge you always end up scrolling away from the task at hand.    I have a few more gripes but I'll spare you, I feel I have written enough.    Best review to date on Sim City in the link.. [...]
