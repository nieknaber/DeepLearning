I was suckered into buying the xbox 360 back when the ps3 was a couple hundred dollars more. Ive payed that and more back on xbox live alone. The playstation is just a better console with free multilayer. Why does it cost money? I regret buying the 360 over the ps3. Now that they're equal pricing, there's no excuse to get this piece or.
