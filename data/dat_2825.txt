The download took a few hours, but once it was finished, it loaded and was ready to play within minutes.  No problems with the download or install.  I'm still learning how to play, but this game seems great so far!    Update #1:  Like the previous reviewer, I too had the same problem with the software asking for a disk after a few days.  After talking to Amazon customer service, I was directed to the software web site forums, where I found the answer to my problem.  Since I am running Microsoft Vista, if I run the program as an administrator it does not ask me for a disk anymore...Problem solved, though I didn't receive any help from Amazon...Disappointed in the customer service, but still happy with the game...
