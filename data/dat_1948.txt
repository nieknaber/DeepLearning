I have played most of the Mumbo Jumbo hidden objects games, and enjoyed those, so I wanted to try a different type of Hidden Objects game.  I thought the concept of this game was original and interesting.  It was also on sale, so this was the one I chose to try.<br /><br />Playing the game, though, was a strange combination of too-easy and too-frustrating for me.  Finding the hidden objects was the easy part.  Some of the items and their locations were repeated several times throughout the game, which made them quite easy to find.  There are also a sufficient number if hints if you get stuck.  The spot-the-differences scenes were more challenging for me, but that was just in comparison to the hidden objects scenes.  If you get stuck on a spot-the-differences scene, the game will automatically give you a hint after a period of inactivity.<br /><br />The movie itself, and the ease of the game part, might make this game seem more appropriate to pre-teens than adults.  However, many of the objects to find are smoking paraphernalia, alcohol bottles and glasses, or medications.  That might not matter to many people, but it does matter to me when selecting games for children.<br /><br />The aspects of the game that frustrated me were things that didn't seem very intuitive.  Tips, hints, and instructions popped up for many parts of the game, so the parts that didn't have such information confused me for awhile.  People that don't over-think things might not have any problem, but I DO over-think things.  At one point I thought I had done the game all wrong, and I needlessly started over.  I'll explain.  While playing the game, some movie clips have more than one location associated with them for the game part.  I noticed that if you don't click those locations in a certain order, the ones you didn't play disappear, and the game won't let you go back to play them.  This leads to certain collectible items not being accessible, such as the movie posters.  When you get to the end of the game, you need to click on &#34;status&#34; and assemble your Premiere Pass jigsaw.  When I saw &#34;8 of 10 collected&#34; for my jigsaw, I assumed that I had missed some pieces of the pass because of the locations I was unable to access, so I started over and tried to click on the scenes in a different order.  I was able to play locations I had missed before, but I still missed some... so at the end I had missing movie posters and &#34;8 of 10 collected&#34; for the jigsaw.  This time, I tried to assemble the pass anyway, and discovered that it DID let me finish that mini-game!!  I guess that &#34;piece 9&#34; is assembling the jigsaw, and &#34;piece 10&#34; is the letter mini game that starts when the usher lets you into the Chinese Theatre.<br /><br />When I thought I had done the game wrong, the only reason I started over was I wanted to see how the movie ended.  The rest of the game didn't have enough re-play value for me to bother with it.  I wouldn't really recommend this game to people who have already seen the movie, unless you're attracted to the novel way of re-watching it.  The only thing that kept me playing until the end was the movie, which I had never seen before.  The bonus scenes and &#34;DVD Extras&#34; that I collected throughout the game were interesting too.<br /><br />I feel that I got my money's worth, but it was on sale for a very inexpensive price.  If it had been full-price, it would not have been worth it for me.
