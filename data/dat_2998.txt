Thought this would be a quick way to get my microsoft points without having to go to the store.  Sadly, the order never finished processing so I never got the code.  Also, I could not cancel the order.  I will put an additional review up to mention how long it took to rectify the situation.  On a further note, Amazon does not have a way to get in touch with them to solve this problem nor do they have a published email address.  I was thinking of buying a kindle later on but now I am having second thoughts.
