This game is probably exactly as it was when it was originally published. I bough the entire SEGA package, thinking how much fun it would be to play these games again. The truth is, my eyes have become jaded. They want HD now. The game is not the problem, It's me. (I've used that somewhere) The picture is pix-elated on my monitor as it probably was originally. I just remember the games being better. Buy one to try. If that works on your equipment, and you like it, buy the rest of them. That is what I should have done. sniff.
