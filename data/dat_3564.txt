DA1+ Expansion: Complex, Strategy filled, full customization, charming and well written characters, story and plot, tough decisions to make, you feel invested in the game.<br /><br />DA2: Generic action game that plays itself.  The characters and story are not very interesting but well written. The problem is gamepaly and its mechanics.  You will see a total of 4-5 dungeons in the whole game, then in every quest, you will literally revisit these same dungeons 20-30 more times, with the only difference to them is that some rooms get closed off. Nothing changes, from enemy type to their spawning points. It's just a rushed, and horrible game.<br />*Warning, the most interesting part of the game is the Intro, which go figure, it's what the DEMO shows, and it ends where the real game and gameplay begins.
