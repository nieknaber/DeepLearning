I originally found a copy of Sacred 2: Fallen Angel for the Xbox 360 at a used games-and-books store in town. Recently, I misplaced the whole thing, game and case included. In my search to find a replacement, I stumbled upon Amazon's sale of Sacred 2 and was quick to act on it. This is the first PC game that I have ever purchased, and I'm glad it was this one. The controls are simple, and rather intuitive, not requiring much advanced skill to learn. You can move with the arrow keys, or by simply right-clicking with the mouse, left-clicking attacks, pressing &#34;G&#34; uses your Divine Gift skill, pressing &#34;S&#34; selects all nearby items, and so on. The playable world is expansive, and you'll spend hours exploring before you even progress in the story (at least, I have so far). The enemies are matched to your current Level, becoming more numerous, or stronger, as your character gains more skill and attack damage. With an impressive 600+ side quests, this game is expansive, enveloping, and downright entertaining. The Gold version even adds two more locations, with additional quests, weapons, enemies, and plot to the game. A worthy buy for anybody looking to just have some fun, and pass the hours immersed in a beautiful game world.
