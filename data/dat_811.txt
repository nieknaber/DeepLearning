I played the original 2nd encounter and loved it....<br /><br />I only gave this one 3 stars.. cuz... I couldn't tell the difference....  HD... WTF is that....<br /><br />So I ended up playing the same game with a different title again....<br /><br />It seems to me that part of the original game is missing???  AM I missing something....
