Really poor console port, terrible graphics, stale gameplay. Barely worth the 5 bucks sale price. SCORE 45/100.<br /><br />I'm still willing to give it a few more go's, but there just isn't a lot there. I cannot emphasize how terrible the graphics are. It does not matter how beastly your graphics card is, this thing will not look good. AND IT DOES NOT SUPPORT 1440p or 1600p nor does it have any graphics adjustments. The lighting, shadows, and textures all look straight from the 360/PS3 era with zero effort given. It also has awful clipping.<br /><br />Honestly, I enjoyed ZombiU on the WiiU a lot more than this, and it was only a pretty good game. This is tolerable but with so many Zombie-type games out there, this one just shouldn't get much of your time, attention, or money.
