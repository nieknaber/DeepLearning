Just Cause 2 is an underrated modern classic. Whereas most games are pitting you in miscellaneous US wars and rushing you through 7 hours of explosions and bloody screens, Just Cause 2 gives you an entire island as a playground.    The voice acting is laughable and the main story is pretty much non-existent, but who cares when your mission is to fly a jet fighter, grapple to a missile in mid air, and destroy it? Tons of wacky stuff like this happens all the time, all set in one of the best looking environments in modern gaming. The view distance in this game is incredible, too. A lot of times, you'll be flying a helicopter to your next mission, and you'll want to pause and admire the sun reflecting off of the water in this tropical paradise (that you will blow up).    The game also has tons of things to find and collect for those who are OCD about it.    All in all, a great game. Worth it at retail price on release, and definitely worth it at its current price.
