I've been playing Civ5, with Gods & Kings, and the Explorer's expansion for a couple of weeks. My platform is a stock Toshiba Qosmio X505-Q8102 laptop, with 4Gb RAM and Nvidia M460 graphics. All drivers are up to date, and I've optimized the machine for gaming (read: stripped out all unnecessary software applications, dumbed down Windows to the Classic view to reduce memory overhead, and I've eliminated all nonvital background processes). That said, I've experienced no difficulties whatsoever running Civ5.<br /><br />My Civ5 preference runs to marathon proportions, meaning my games often run to over 2,000 turns. At no time have I experienced game slowdown or loss of graphics quality.<br /><br />Mind you, I'm not now, nor have I ever been a computer professional; rather, I'm a 62-year-old retired History teacher. So, having read a number of reviews, here and elsewhere, criticizing Civ5's performance, I'm convinced the problem is with players' PC setup and not the game.
