For two days EA has had my money for a product I can't use.  I'm talking about Simcity of course.  I can't log in to a server or build a city or anything.  The only luck I've had is playing the tutorial at 7:00 this morning.  In the past, I've owned all the sim games from the original Simcity, to SimFarm.  Each one was worth the money I paid for it and then some.  Now that Maxis has been taken over by EA, words like quality and integrity are abstract concepts.  What I believe happened was that some executive decided revenue was needed to offset the game development costs and ordered the release of a product that was not ready.  They probably figured they would have a patch ready by now and there would be no problem.  By the way their stock reached a 52 week high, I'm guessing due to advanced sales of this piece of junk.  We need to keep on them until they fix this or word of this reaches investors which will get their attention.  I'm also calling on Amazon to apply their significant leverage to EA to make this right.  If they turn a blind eye, I just may discontinue my prime status.  I hope everyone that reads this will stay away from Simcity until it is finally fixed.
