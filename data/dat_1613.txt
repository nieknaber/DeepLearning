Dead Space 3 is an awesome game, great story, lots of guns, and of course brutality. But if you're like me and love the Dead Space franchise for the sheer horror thrill. Then you'll be disappointed. I don't know who they where trying to impress by changing the gameplay, but the beautiful horror game it once was turned into a third person action shooter. That feeling of helplessness when youre low on ammo and in a dark room clinging with your nails for dear life - you never get that here. Its just that same frustration you get from a third person shooter. They also have this new system to upgrade your suit and weapons by finding supplies, instead of the original nodes, I think this is just complete garbage in hopes to make the game unique from the new developers. Anywho, if you're new to the Dead Space games you'll definitley enjoy it, and if you're like me who had been waiting for the moment to play this game for a couple years now, sorry, but this game just doesn't have the same kick..
