I will start by stating I have no axe to grind.  People that enjoyed this game, great, I am happy for you!<br />There are a couple of reasons not to purchase this game, the biggest by far, is not being able to save<br />your game.  This game works on an auto-save checkpoint system, that's it.  You can't just stop and<br />save when you're tired, get called into work, etc.  A deal-breaker for me.  Another reason I find the game<br />boring is the inability to explore the game world.  Sure, the scenery is beautiful, but you can't go through<br />75%+ of doors/gates to see it first-hand.  So much is off-limits.  You don't have to worry too much about<br />getting lost or not knowing where to go as it's terribly linear, so that may be a positive to some players.<br />Hope this helps people make an informed decision...on to the next game!  Cheers
