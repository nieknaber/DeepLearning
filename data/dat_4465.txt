You see... I have read Nancy Drew books from age 7. And this game... did NOT stand up to those books. OR any of the other games for that matter. The mystery was predictable, it had a good idea, but the execution was very off. The puzzles were boring and easy, and if they weren't.. again, BORING. The characters were very flat and had no depth what so ever. I love Nancy Drew games, but this one was a let down.
