This requirement to have to go through steam to get to the game installation is extremely time consuming even for computer literate people.  Tons of error messages.  You tube has a lot of videos about all the troubles you will encounter once you purchase the download.  Most don't really help.  After 3 hours of trying to get started still will not play.  Most I could do is get to the demo which crashed before it even started the game (and I have 4gbs of ram).  Feeling like I've been taken for my money and at this point not even too interested in playing this game anymore.  SMH
