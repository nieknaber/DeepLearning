I heard about the problems this game had at launch and everyone saying don't buy it. Everyone was saying that its a great and fun game when it works. Now that most of its problems with actually playing the game are fixed, I finally bought the game and I am disappointed. Its hardly any fun and when I play it I feel more \\"I'm playing this so I can distract myself from my boredom\\" instead of feeling \\"I'm playing this because its fun\\". When ever I play I run out of city space just as it starts to get good. Online play is boring as no one talks to each other and when you start a new city  around other developed or developing cities, you are attacked by criminals as soon as you start to build and the demand for any buildings is so low that development of your city is outrageously slow. After playing about 2 hours of this game I feel like I have done everything that the game has to offer. Simcity 4 is a way better experience in my opinion and I recommend you buy that game instead.
