At first look it is well done but a couple days of play reveals many flaws, the biggest of which being it is not designed for a computer. It becomes painfully obvious that the game was designed for a console and ported to the PC as an afterthought. The interface is cumbersome to navigate and discourages social interaction, it plays like a single player game with a tease it could be multiplayer. There are to many servers for the player base which makes the multiplayer content very difficult to experience, i have sat for hours waiting in queue for a multiplayer instance but have yet to see one because there were never enough players to fill the queue for even one group.    Overall the graphics are pretty well done but the cosmetic options available quickly become a limit to character concept. There are a lot of body stocking designs, but most of them are ugly, and there is a very limited cosmetic selection other than lycra tights and shirts. There are more designs that are acquired during play but a cohesive style that fits a character concept will not become available til top level and many hours of grinding away at top level. I expected more from SOE with as many games as they have published but they have not gotten any better at multiplayer since they first released EverQuest, they have actually gotten worse at multiplayer and just ported over a console game without adapting the interface or controls to the computer.    I won't stay subscribed to the game for long, a few months at most, it is already getting old after less than a month.
