Almost bug free at launch for me.  Pretty amazing.  Graphics style is similar to wow.... Cartoonish but I'm ok with that . Tons of content already.  Feels like an established game. The combat is new. I like the style. It shows where you are attacking. You have to aim .  Not hard though.  Crafting takes a little getting used to.  You have to discover item by trying different combinations of material. Was kind of frustrating at first but I got the hang of it. Fairly easy to get a group to do the group quests.  I have really been enjoying it I reckon !!  Lots of lore to discover.  Pretty neat overall story.  Mob fights are unique to each.  You can dodge their attack. If you don't , a regular mob can drop your health quite a bit . Have not tried pvp at all. Sorry!!
