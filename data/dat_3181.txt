I decided to purchase this game about a week ago, and I must say that this is money well spent. Any fan of South Park will absolutely love this game due to his humor and fun from general gameplay.<br /><br />Just as the title suggests, this is a tower defense type of game in which one must built walls and towers to prevent the enemies from destroying South Park. Trust me, it may seem complicated, but it's loads of fun once you learn about which towers work best against different enemies.<br /><br />Lots of references to the show throughout the game, so prepare to laugh your butt off.<br /><br />One last note to mention: this game is also a blast to play with friends. I've had a blast owning the entire game with my buddies, so this game gets the highest rating.
