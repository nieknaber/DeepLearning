I picked up the game on sale so I wasn't expecting too much for such an inexpensive purchase (never played the first one).  However, this is the first game I have played all the way through the campaign in a long time.<br /><br />I know this game has been compared a lot to Warcraft, Age of Empires, Starcraft and the like (which I have all played) but in my opinion it is in its own little niche.  It is an RTS but the inability to issue direct commands makes for some really interesting game play.  I found it to be very entertaining trying to decide how much to pay my heroes in order to accomplish tasks versus saving the money to buy upgrades or new heroes.  Overall, I found it to be a very original idea.<br /><br />I did not find the difficulty to be too challenging but neither did I find it to be simple.  Generally I was able to pass the missions on my first try though a few I did have to restart once.  Usually, once you find a good defensive mix of units you can survive long enough to build up and win.  There did not appear to be a huge amount of viable strategies but there was definitely more than one path you could choose.<br /><br />Overall, the game was fun, the graphics were pretty good (not award winning but didn't make my eyes bleed or anything), and the sound was amusing and didn't get repetitive enough to be annoying.  With about 1 hour of play per campaign mission there was good 20 hours of game play plus the non-campaign scenarios.  Well worth it if you can get a good deal on price.
