Great price, $10 for all three. I love Borderlands and i think it's better on PC. The Darkness II was extremely fun. and...even though...Duke Nukem got terrible reviews, it's a Great time killer. i can stomach the campaign, but online i could do with out. even though i did find out that there is a weapon storage expansion setting to let you hold more weapons. but C'mon, it's the same voice actor, same guns, same enemy's. Some reboots change everything. this one didn't change much
