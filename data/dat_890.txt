I love all of the Blue Fish Hidden Expdetion Games. However, the latest ones seem to stump me more than the previous ones. And, the frustration that causes is high. On the games, \\"Titanic\\", \\"London\\", \\"Paris\\", \\"Everest\\", there is a way to have a hint. But on \\"Amazon\\", when you get to play the individual game, there is no clue, or it is a very mysterious clue, you can't proceed to the next level. You become stuck. Nowhere to go and no place to help you.
