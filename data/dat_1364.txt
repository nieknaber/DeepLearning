Was very interested in playing this game but after purchase I found that I had to go through Steam to be able to play. Not only do I not like the hassle of the extra step to download the game but I do not like a third party like Steam managing my game play. Also without an internet connection it is impossible to play at first and a hassle after you finally finish all the signup procedures with Steam. For a game that I planned on playing off line against the computer I was so mad that Amazon agreed to return the game (five stars for Amazon).<br /><br />Gamers should be able to purchase games without third party management and then sign up for these services as an option, not a mandatory requirement.
