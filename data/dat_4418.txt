Great set of games! Requires a decent computer with a good video card but once you get up and running it offers a nice mix of games that are fun to play and keep you entertain for hours. Wish there were more arcade collections like this available legally for the PC! Very easy to map the keys to a hand held controller.<br /><br />Companies need to bring Neo Geo, Capcom and various other arcade games to the PC. So far we have IREM and SEGA offering such products. I'm very satisfied with this collection offered by IREM. I believe you would enjoy it too if you are an old school arcade gamer.
