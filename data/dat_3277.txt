Fun game to play.  I was fortunate enough not to have a problem with the download.  As a matter of fact, my computer crashed because of another game during the download, and after reboot the download continued automatically.  Now if I could just figure out how to get off the first island...  I picked up 2 maps, but can't find a ship with a travel light.
