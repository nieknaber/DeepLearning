I admit that I really do dislike the the &#34;Cash Stores&#34; that have come attached to the mmorpg Free To Play models within the industry. I even dislike the term Free To Play because it really isn't true for most of the games that use it. Trust this gamer when I say most games are, and will be, subscription based for the foreseeable future if you genuinely want the full benefits of playing a mmorpg. That isn't what you wanted to read here though...<br /><br />Basically, you do get exactly what you pay for on the Cartel Coins. Pay the fee, get the code, enter it... get that many cartel coins. So far I haven't had a hitch getting the associated Exclusive items either. Do note though that the exclusives do change and likely will in the future too. If you want an exclusive item... get it while it is being advertised.<br /><br />If you like SWTOR and have given in to buying things from the Cartel Market, or have a gamer in your family that does, this isn't a bad buy for your buck.
