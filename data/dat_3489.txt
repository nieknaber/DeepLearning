Although I enjoyed playing the original Rocksmith, the new version includes many improvements.  I'm learning to play guitar and didn't want (at this point) pay for lessons.  The game makes it easy and fun to learn.  In the '14 version it's easier to know what note to play and shows the finger &#34;shape&#34; to play chords.  There are videos which show how to string your guitar, how to hold & pick the strings and much more.  Check out YouTube videos on reviews of the original and the new version.  I'm very pleased with my purchase.
