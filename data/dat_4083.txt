I love this game, I got it for free for pre-ordering Bioshock, and while Bioshock is great fun, I have honestly sunk way more time into XCOM. I love turn based strategy, normally I play Civilization, but the combat in this was just too much fun. Mixed in with just enough RPG elements(unit upgrades and skilltrees along with tech trees and buildings) this game totally scratches that itch. Hands down the best turn based strategy game I have played in years.
