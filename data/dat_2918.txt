No need to add to the outline above. This game takes effort to master and quite a bit of finesse to get it just right. Bikes handle just like they do in the real world so there is no arcade racing here... before embarking on a career, spend lots of time on the practice track. The learning curve is steep if you are a non rider but worth it in the end.
