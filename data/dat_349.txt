DLC issues aside, the add on content is not worth the price.  I have the digital delux ed with Heros, French, German, and English city sets. By the time you have the 500k to plop down one of the tourist buildings (eiffel tower, big ben, brandenburg gate) you probably don't have many of the med sized buildings they advertise around your city.  What you get is the tourist building (as useful as the standard issue ones), a utility building without significant difference from standard, and if you look around \\"where's waldo\\" style you might spot one or two french buildings buried beneath the skyscrapers.  (i have yet to see an english or german style building in my cities). Forget ever seeing euro towns like the screenshots depict.<br /><br />Basically, those of us who paid for the 'extras' got scammed and like the title says, you'd get more for your money by buying an .99 app for your phone.
