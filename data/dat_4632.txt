It's an overall great game. The graphics are incredible and the atmosphere is jaw dropping to say the least. The gameplay is pretty good but there are moments where it's pretty strange such as being inches away from an enemies face only for him not to see you. There is also something that happens at the end which should've been handled better.<br /><br />Also note if you have an and card you'll have to disable physix in the gameplay options. It's not in the video settings for some reason.
