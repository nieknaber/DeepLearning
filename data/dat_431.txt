A friend and I thought we'd buy this game to ya know...play versus each other? Impossible to do without jumping through a horrible interface and a lot of hoops. I've been playing games for a loooong time now and this is by far the worst port I've ever seen. How do  you make an online sports game and not have the ability to play against friends with ease?
