I've always been a big fan of Jet Set Radio. Loved it on Dreamcast and still love it on steam. Controls are updated a bit with the camera being controlled by the 2nd analog stick. That was nice to see. Graphics are updated and look great. I did have some issues getting the game to run at full speed for some reason. I have a Quad core and it lagged really bad, I disabled 2 cores, rebooted it played at full speed. Then I re-enabled all 4 cores and rebooted and it still played at full speed. Weird?? But it works, Yay!<br /><br />Pros: Great game<br />Looks great<br />Controls are better on the 360 controller than on Dreamcast<br /><br />Cons: Seems to have issues with high end PC's
