I really enjoyed the game, but they have taken a hard line with very unusual subscription practices. They force you to accept a pre authorization for the full amount of the subscription you choose. For most this means you need 15 bucks on top of the box cost, but as this was all kept quiet before launch many are being charged for 3 and 6 month subs immediately which is upward of 50-70 bucks.<br /><br />Long story short, they are forcing you to agree to pay for one month before giving you your free 30 days, making it actually a two for one deal and not a &#34;free&#34; 30 days. They also will not accept pre paid cards or re loadable cards for subscriptions.<br /><br />Unbelievable really that they blundered this hard. This one is gonna haunt you Zenimax!
