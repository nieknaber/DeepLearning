This game is a search for hidden objects game and it is pretty good.  It is not baby easy but also not too hard....just relaxing fun.  I counted one game and found that I had searched 83 rooms in order to spruce up the garden!!  Going on to buy them  clothes is a bit much but did it once.  Perfect game for passing time and relaxing before going to bed!!
