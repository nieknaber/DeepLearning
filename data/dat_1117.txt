This game is really fun in the beginning and takes some memorization skills.  Pretty much, you own a sushi restaurant, and you need to make certain types of sushi that customer requests by memorizing what ingredients go into the roll or sushi.  The ingredients get more complicated as you go.  When you earn coins, you can buy things that help you go faster, build your reputation, buy ingredients faster, etc.  However, it only took me a few hours to beat, and then I played it through another time and now I am bored of it.  So, it's just too easy and you would get only a few day's worth of gaming out of this.
