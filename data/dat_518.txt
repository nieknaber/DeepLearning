I don't like paying to play. In buying my Xbox I thought the whole gold thing was sort of lame. I still do. I understand they have to keep servers up and what not. But it is still lame. That said though buying a 12 month gold membership on sale Amazon is probably the best way to go. I cost less than buying it through the Xbox store and won't auto-resubscribe. I've heard t hey stack too, so you can buy one anytime and import to code and it will just add it to the current count of months you have available.
