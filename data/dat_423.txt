I have been playing for over 2 weeks now and I can seriously put this game in my top ten of all time. The PC port isn't amazing, with a terrible Vsync system built in but can be tinkered with to make playable. Running on my 4770k @4.4ghz, 16gb RAM, and GTX 780 I stay over 60fps with most settings up and vsync on adaptive. The story of this game is rich and so is the world you play in, with the most realistic ocean any game has presented yet, EVER.
