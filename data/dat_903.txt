If you really want to play PS1 games on your PS3, install Linux and use an open source emulator like PCSX ([...]). The emulator Sony employs doesn't even try to upscale the graphics, and the simple filters they use make it look even more horrible. The open source emulators do a fantastic job, and you can usually the the original PS1 disc for less than the $[...] that Sony charges for these downloadable PS1 games.    Beyond the presentation, Spyro is just an overall mediocre game. The story is trite, characters are boring archetypes, and the platforming and puzzles are shallow at best. That being said, everything controls nicely and the difficulty ramp-up is pretty smooth and consistent.    In short, if Sony added some value with better emulation and upscaling, this might be a three-star game and worth $[...]. They didn't, so it's not.
