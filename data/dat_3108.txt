Dead Island is a good game, with an actual storyline.  While there are inevitable comparisons to other cooperative survival horror games such as Left 4 Dead, Dead Island rises above the similarities to deliver a solid and unique gaming experience.<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />- Good graphics.<br />- Responsive controls.<br />- Entertaining voice acting.<br />- Visceral combat.  The hard hits look and feel like hard hits, in other words.<br />- Cooperative, and a lot more fun with a friend.<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />- Combat can get stale, coupled with the following...<br />- Weapons degrade and break at a very fast pace.  While this seems to be a way to make people switch things up and keep the combat fresh, it gets frustrating having to look everywhere and at everything as a potential weapon.<br />- Some of the missions get repetitive.  This is largely solved when you play cooperatively though, as other players add a new dynamic to the experience.
