I don't see any differences between this and the Sega Genesis version.  The music, sounds, characters and the same.  The only difference is that you have to use the keyboard as a controller.  It's just not the same as the old Genesis controller.  You get used to certain thumb/finger movements and have to re-think it when you're using the keyboard now.  I assume once you get used to the keyboard, it's not so bad any more... but I didn't wait that long.  I just liked hearing the sounds and seeing the game once more.  Maybe you could do the same by just viewing a YouTube video instead of buying the game?
