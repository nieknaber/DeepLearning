This game is completely awful. You sit and wait to even find a game on multiplayer. And when you do find a game you'll join and it will be full of hackers who kill you instantly. It's not even close to realistic or the hackers are just that bad. You can shoot somebody in the face 3 times and and they wont die but they'll shoot you once and you will. Don't waist your time nor your money on this game. Everyone else has the same issues look at all the reviews online about their COD Black Ops 2 servers. I was a big fan of MW3 and Black Ops 1 but this game right here is so bad I'm done with the COD games completely.
