The game plays a little bit with its one liners and humor like the game House Of The Dead Overkill and though the graphics and effects in the game are pretty excellent the aiming is pretty sloppy.  The game has you use the PS4 controller not the controller sticks to maneuver your targeting sight towards the enemies and that's where its biggest flaw lies.  The targeting setup is pretty glitchy to begin with and while you can re-sight it in the game to go back to the center it becomes more then annoying sometimes when you're in a major gunfight.<br /><br />The game plays in chapters allowing you to play two different characters in specific chapters and while the game is fun it's also pretty short only about 8 chapter segments but still a decent amount of gameplay for $20.  The game is a good addition to the digital PS4 library and apart from the less then stellar targeting at times it's still an entertaining game nonetheless.
