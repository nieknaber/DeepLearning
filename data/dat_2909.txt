Wheel of Fortune on the PS3 is simply amazing.  You can play online with your friends, play locally or by yourself.  The graphics are very good for a downloadable game.  This game stays true to the real Wheel of Fortune that you play at home.  Realistic sounds, prizes and the AI are well balanced.  The only thing missing is Pat Sajak and Vanna White.  But regardless to that minor flaw, this game is one of the best Wheel of Fortune games out there.
