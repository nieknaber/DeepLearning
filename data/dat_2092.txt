I actually enjoyed this expansion but I felt like they could've done more. It would've been neat if some existing jobs were given the same &#34;interactive&#34; treatment. I do like that it gives you the choice to just send you Sim by themselves like a normal job, because it can get tiring if you're stuck with the same objectives every day. I appreciate that they tried to mix up the daily routine but the same things still seem to come up a lot. My verdict: buy it if you are a Sims fanatic, but wait for a sale...
