For retro-gamers feening for their 16 Bit era fix on their PC, Sega Genesis Classics Series (volumes 1-4) ain't a bad deal. But, be warned, emus (Kega Fusion, Gens 32) do a much better job.  There are obvious PROS & CONS to going the Amazon Digital Download route.<br /><br />PROS:<br />Good selection of Genesis fan favorites, $7.50 for 10 games is a steal when compared to the Wii's Virtual Console prices ($6-$10 per individual game), controls easily map to USB gamepads (I use a Logitech Dual Action).<br /><br />CONS:<br />Steep system requirements (1.6GHz CPU, 2GB RAM, 32MB video card for 16 Bit era games? WTF?), some really good games are still missing -like \\"Phantasy Star 4\\", will NOT run on Linux nor Mac.<br /><br />So, as you can see, SGCS is quite a mixed bag. It's not bad, but there are better options floating around on the web. But if you have hang-ups regarding emus, it's nice to know that there is a decent alternative. Not as good, but decent.
