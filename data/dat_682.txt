I have no interest in the &#34;online missions&#34;, and therefore have had little success unlocking weapon upgrades.  Setting that aside, this game gets an A+ for entertainment factor!  I played through the entire game twice because I enjoyed it so much.<br /><br />After being thoroughly disappointed with Max Payne 3, my concern was that maybe Max Payne 3 is as good as it gets for a current-gen game, that was clearly written for the console first.  Hitman shows that it's possible to write a current-gen game with all the modern bells and whistles, but WITHOUT the glitchiness and poor camera control of MP-3.  I assure you, I did NOT get stuck on any furniture or doorways while playing this game -- Rockstar could learn some lessons about player control!<br /><br />Faith in gaming:  RESTORED
