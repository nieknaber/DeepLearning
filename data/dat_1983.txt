No, just no. I feel like EA has taken great shortcuts and removed so many features with the Sims 4. The Sims 3 was great and I would be ashamed to know how many hours I spent playing the Sims 3. Yeah, there are some cool new things about the Sims 4, but they have REMOVED over 89 features. Really EA, really? How stupid do you think your customers are? The world is extremely small, there is a loading screen between EVERY lot, even your neighbors lot. The biggest killer for me, NO STORY PROGRESSION. All people do is get older. No one gets married, has children, or ANYTHING unless you MAKE THEM. What kind of Sim game is that? In real life you don't walk over to your neighbors house and say, hey, it's time you get married and have children now. So all Sims are simple robots who only eat, sleep, and die. I could go on and on, but I'll put in as much effort into this review as EA did into their $70 game. Besides, finding information on how bad The Sims 4 is isn't hard, it's widely known in the gaming community. No, I DO NOT recommend this game to anyone. Don't waste your money, or at least return the game and spend your money elsewhere if you do, and wait to see if the Sims 5 is any better.
