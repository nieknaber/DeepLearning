I love this game, open world and cool missions to do with awesome cars and DLC,but there's one thing that i don't like...<br />the story really doesn't have the &#34;gangster&#34; meaning to it like Saints Row 2 and down. It looks alot like a comedy with wierd zombies and alien movies all of that but it just didnt keep that awesome gangsta feel it had like in saints row 2. that's really all i didn't like about it. over all good game.
