I was a bit concerned with getting the starter pack since all of the bad reviews however it worked flawlessly for me. I risked the $15 and was very happy. The only thing I would recommend is to download the origin client and make your origin account first. This just makes it so much easier. All you do is then look at the product keys which you download from amazon when you buy the starter pack (or I think you can go into your account and find it under digital games or something like that). Then in your origin client press the &#34;origin&#34; tab at the top left corner and then press redeem product code. *note: you have to enter the three product codes separately. The actual game is good and what you expect. $15 is a CRAZY price for this starter pack. I know some websites sell it for over $50. Definitely recommend if you like sims
