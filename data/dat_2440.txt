PlanetSide 2 is more difficult than the older games released in the early 2000s.  The tutorial is going to take awhile.  Even the tutorial reports you will need quite a bit of experience in the game before becoming proficient.  Otherwise, the game is above average in maintaining one's interest and the graphics are quite good.  The story and role playing having a variety of alternatives to make the game flexible and a combative adventure.  Perhaps later, when I become proficient, my rating will go up.  For beginners this is a challenging game that will result in a slower learning curve.  Good luck.  If you know someone that is familiar with the game you will benefit from them helping you learn the game.
