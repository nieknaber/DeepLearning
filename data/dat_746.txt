UPDATE:<br />I realized that my graphics card barfs if anti-aliasing is enabled. I disabled it and the game has not crashed since last 1 hour. I will keep testing and update my review. As of now, I think I am highly satisfied!<br /><br />ORIGINAL:<br />I am a huge fan of Street Fighter games having played them in coin operated arcade machines as a kid. When I recently bought an Xbox controller for Windows, I decided to buy this game for my PC to have some fun. However, the game is highly unstable. It is extremely difficult to get it to run without crashing with the error - Street Fighter IV has stopped working - atleast 3-4 times. I have searched several forums on the internet and have tried various suggested solutions but nothing changes. Though, when it does run continuously for some time, it is a lot of fun. I am extremely disappointed with this purchase. I hope the next Street Figher game, the Street Fighter x Tekken, which is scheduled to release this month for PC, does not behave in this manner.<br /><br />PC:<br />Windows 7 Home Premium 64bit<br />AMD A8 3870<br />8GB RAM<br />NVidia GEForce GT520
