This is a game that can definitely burn a number of hours as you build up forces and try to conquer the world.  In style of play it most resembles Elemental or Civ V than other older turn-based 4X games.<br /><br />I have to say that I liked elemenats of hte game, but could not call this a masterpiece.  The standard for most fantasy 4X games is still Master of Magic.  Yes, the graphics are terrible, but the shear number of races and spells and the addition of heroes made the game a huge step up compared to the other options.  Age of Wonders tries to capture the same elements, but for me it never quite achieved the same elegance.<br /><br />Warlock doesn't try to be as expansive as Master of Magic.  There are only 3 races and no technology tree.  The only research is for spells, and the research tree is rather linear, you see 5 options to research and from what I could see the system works by a \\"researched X spell and spell X+1 appears in the tree.  The spells appear to follow a very linear tech tree.<br /><br />Combat is not much different than Civ V, the lack of stacking makes it a bit more tactically than Civ IV, but it's still rather straightforward in execution.<br /><br />Honestly, this feels like it could have been a lot better if more time had been spent expanding options.  The lack of races, the lack of a tech tree, the linear nature of spell research, all leaft me thinking the game could be so much more.<br /><br />But I love 4X games, so I still enjoy this one.  It plays faster and smoother than Elemental, and while lacking in some elements, does not have the same balance issues that make Elemental nearly impossible to enjoy.<br /><br />If you like 4X games, and like the idea of adding magic, this is worth trying.  Otherwise, it will likely frustrate you.
