Amazon had this on sale from $20 to $5. It has 4 player coop, you can level up (though, the # of ranks is rather daunting. 145 reputation levels?! Im on level 20, you get ~2 rep levels per mission. Possibly more at higher difficulties), you can map the buttons on your keyboard, there is a matchmaking system so u never have to play alone (unless for some reason u like playing multiplayer coop games by yourself!).<br /><br />Hipfire is very accurate for some reason, I dont know why!<br /><br />By my criteria im looking for $1/hour entertainment. This was $5 and ive already put 15 hours into it.<br /><br />Great game for cheap!
