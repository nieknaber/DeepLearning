I'm sure there are features of PlayStation Plus I haven't used yet, but I'll go over the ones I do use.<br /><br />Free games - There are, at any given time, about 10 or 15 free full-length games available digitally to subscribers. These are changed regularly and have included big names like Street Fighter, Darksiders, Mega Man, Little Big Planet, Ratchet and Clank, etc. You could amass a pretty decent collection just in free games, especially if you're a casual gamer. You only get to use those games while you're a paid subscriber, but the price makes it well worth it.<br /><br />Discounts - You get discounts on most downloads in the PlayStation store. You can get popular games for as little as a couple of dollars sometimes (I bought Journey for about $2.50, I think). Usually discount is about 25%, and unlike the free games, the ones you buy with your discount are yours whether you remain a paid subscriber or not.<br /><br />Cloud storage - PS Plus allows you to store save files via Cloud, a feature not available to non-subscribers. This allows me to retrieve save files I have on friends' consoles, as well as back up my save files to play on other peoples' consoles. In the event that something happens to my PS3 (God forbid), my save files are safely stored online. The saves are easy to store and retrieve.<br /><br />Exclusive betas, etc. - PS Plus gives subscribers exclusive access to early betas and demos of games. This is probably going to appeal to more serious gamers, but it's cool to check out upcoming games before release date.<br /><br />All in all, I think for $50 per year, this is a great value. It's well worth the price.
