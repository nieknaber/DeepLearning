Recommended for the finest in all three of these categories. As a bonus the difficulty may be set from very easy to insanely difficult, depending on your mood. The plot starts with a simple story of a private detective on a mission to rescue a woman, set in the early 1900's, and ends with a profound depth that leaves you astonished with the skill and storytelling mastery from the developer.  It is difficult to tell you more without introducing spoilers. I recommend you just play it and see everything as it unfolds.
