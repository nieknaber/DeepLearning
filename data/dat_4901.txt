If you have Borderlands 2 but don't have this dlc, I recommend you get this. This will add all sorts of gear into your game and if you got the first one then you will get to go through the 8 stages of OverPower 8.<br />First of all you need Steam, amazon gives you a key code stick it into steam and bam you get it fast.
