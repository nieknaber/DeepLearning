OK...Third time's a charm...I uninstalled and reinstalled the game and after the third time doing it, all seems to be working well. It doesn't want to save my video settings for 1920 x 1080 (which Is why I bought the game in the first place) and it doesn't hold the controller settings I want, but after the sound issue, I'll take it.<br /><br />I'm still not crazy about Steam support (STILL haven't got the support confirmation email) but from what I've learned about Steam since my original post it ain't all that bad.f...Oh by the way...you can't return this version to Amazon. So if you buy it like I, and  many other suckers did, and you have problems, you're stuck with it until Steam support \\"helps\\".<br /><br />I don't know if all version of Lego Lord Of The Rings for PC have to go through Steam, but if they don't, get one that doesn't go through Steam. It might not be the cheapest or quickest way to get one, but if you have problems like I have...you won't be playing at all after you bought it.<br /><br />Oh...I contacted Amazon support and they were good but because this is a game that you get through Steam they said I have to deal with Steam to resolve the problem....Nice
