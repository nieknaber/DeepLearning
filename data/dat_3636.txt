I bought this for my Surface Pro 3, thinking that after all this time, most bugs should be worked out. I got it to uinstall and loaded the Microsoft Live thing, got it to run, but it never got past the title screen. Couldn't find this so called patch to fix the keyboard issue, and of course can't get a refund as I was directed to download if from Amazon
