This game is based on the Napoleonic wars on a strategic level , It is similar to all their other games made just like them , it could be mistaken for a mod of one of their other games but it is still fun and well made , I like it alot. I also like Total Wars Napoleonic Wars with all the dlc which I bought on Steam so between these two games I have the Napoleonic wars covered. NOT for everyone. But if you love history and the history of warfare you will probably like it too.
