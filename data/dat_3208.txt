I have never been compelled to write a review on Amazon.com, but felt that I wanted to share my experiences with the purchase of the PC Download version of DA:O - Ultimate Edition in the hopes that it might help others make an informed decision.<br /><br />Before purchasing the download version of Dragon Age: Origins - Ultimate Edition, I read the reviews regarding download and installation issues that some of the customers were having.  At $9.99 and with a gift card in hand, I figured that I didn't have much to lose by trying.<br /><br />After purchasing the downloadable version of DA:O - Ultimate Edition, I was taken to a page that confirmed the purchase and provided me with a button to click to download the installer package.  No problems at all with the download (a bit over 12GB in size), but to be fair, I have Verizon FIOS, so the download time was probably less than most.  My laptop even went into Sleep Mode overnight and the download was interrupted, and upon bringing it out of Sleep Mode the next morning, the download continued without issue right where it left off.<br /><br />Once downloading was completed, I was given the option to start the installation of DA:O - Ultimate Edition.  Once started, a new page opened that provided the installation key as well as the DLC installation key.  This new page also advised that an account needed to be created on the EA/BioWare website in order to register and run DA:O (not a big deal to me).  Once prompted, I entered the installation key and away I went.  After creating the account with EA/Bioware, I entered the DA:O registration code as well as the DLC installation code on the website.  Once the DA:O - Ultimate Edition was complete, it prompted me for my EA/BioWare login and password for validation.  After entering my login/password information and performing validation of my account, I was able to successfully play DA:O, as well as having access to the Ultimate Edition DLC content that I had previously registered on the EA/Bioware website.  The experience was totally painless, and I had absolutely no issues with downloading, installation, or access to DLC.<br /><br />Again, this is only the review of the PC Download version of DA:O - Ultimate Edition, so I can't speak to the PC Retail version, but I would definitely recommend the PC Download version based on value and ease of installation.experience was totally painless, and I had absolutely no issues with downloading, installation, or access to DLC.
