I tried to sub from the SWTOR site but it said my IP adress didn't match the country I'm registered in (United States). I checked and it is but I didn't want to wait for support. This was easier. I wasn't charged any tax. I got the game code, copy and pasted into the website and everything was good. The change to subscriber in game happened immediately. Good stuff
