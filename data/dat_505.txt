I have always been a fan of the open world / sandbox games like Grand Theft Auto. I have also always been a fan of martial arts movies. This game has the perfect blend of martial arts / fighting / action in an open world / sandbox environment. The graphics are particularly noteworthy, as well as a strong story line, talented voice actors, and just superb game play. There is a lot to do in Sleeping Dogs, and a lot of butt kicking to go around. If you're into adventure / action games driven by an incredibly deep and intricate story, GET THIS GAME!
