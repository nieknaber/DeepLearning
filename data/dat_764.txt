I've seen some bad reviews over the PC version, this is Ubi's fault, keep onm reading and I'll tell you why.<br /><br />Aside from that The game is great. The missions are varied, there's a lot of things to do and side missions do have useful rewards. Is not as open as GTA V, but been able to hack almost anything makes you (to my opinion) even more powerful than you could ever be in a game like GTA. The NPCs are very well designed and react to you and your reputation.<br /><br />Now to graphics, this is were the bad reviews come and where everyone blames Ubi. The game by itself (even after the latest patch up until today) has lag issues in spite of having current hardware (corei5, 8GB RAM, Nvidia 780GTX). But surprise, I downloaded the mod and fixed everything. Not only the mod makes for awesome graphics, but also improves performance. For some reason that I don't understand Ubi decided to take out this graphic options that come with the mod.<br /><br />This game is worth the money, and has a lot of gameplay to keep you hours on it. If you happen to buy it make sure to download the mod, it will really improve on your experience.
