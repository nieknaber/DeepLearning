If you own any modern Sony console (i.e. PS3, PS4, or Vita), you WANT PlayStation Plus. You definitely need it if you want to do online multiplayer for the PS4, but don't compare this to Xbox Live so quickly because you get SO MUCH MORE with PS Plus.<br /><br />Namely, FREE games every month via the Instant Game Collection. And these aren't low-quality, B-rated games; games like Bioshock Infinite, Payday 2, Resogun, and Borderlands 2 have graced the presence of this free collection.  In just its first year, PS Plus gave free access to games valued at over $1,800! On top of free games, you get nice discounts on a lot of stuff in the PS Store.<br /><br />If you want to make PS Plus an even better deal, you should be able to nab a 1-year membership on Amazon for $30 (and maybe some other places) on Black Friday.
