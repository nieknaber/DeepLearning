You play the reporter, Valerie Porter. Your new job at The Informer leads you to investigate bribes, affairs, and murder! The game is fun and entertaining. Excellent voice acting, 9 out of 10 stars.<br />Graphics are well done. The people look like people. Music is good, fits the time period (1920s), and doesn't distract you.<br />There are twelve chapters. You have hidden objects to find, letters to piece together, people to interview, newspaper articles and headlines to write (you fill in the article with words from a list; you typeset the headline filling in the missing letters), equipment to piece together (camera, projector, etc.), and film to develop. You have bells to find. You may earn medals for the bells - one for finding 50 bells and one for finding 100 bells. Game length is just right.<br />There is a bug in this game where it will not play if you have Adobe Flash Player installed. Uninstall the Player. This solution worked for me. When you are finished with game, just reinstall the Player.
