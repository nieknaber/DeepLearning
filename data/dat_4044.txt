I got this game for free as part of the nVidia promotion running on Amazon. I was planning to buy AC3 before hand, so this was a nice bonus. Amazon's digital service offers extremely low download rates. I have a 40Mbps connection and and in the 8 hours I was away while at work it only downloaded 1 GB of the 15GB the game takes. Because the nVidia promotion only applied to the Amazon Digital copy, I couldn't use the product key on Steam.<br /><br />I ended up buying the game on steam and it completely downloaded while I was asleep at night. If Amazon is serious about operating a digital game store, they really need to look at the download speeds competitors offer. I just started playing AC3, so far so good - but I thought this review might be helpful for people who are thinking of buying it through Amazon. The download speed was so slow that I ditched their free promotional copy and bought it from someone else.
