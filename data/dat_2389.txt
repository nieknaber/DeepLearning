This game is slightly different from other Tomb Raider games. Mainly because of the style it's in. You don't play from 3rd person where the camera is behind Lara all the time. It's more from over head. For me at least, that makes the combat a little more difficult as well as performing some of the challenges. But for what it's worth, I'd recommend this game to any TR fan such as myself. (:
