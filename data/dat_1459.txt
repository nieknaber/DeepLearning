Off the bat, I took away 2 stars for being forced to use Uplay. It doesn't add any value. I'm forced to create another user account for another service that I don't want.<br /><br />The game is pretty. There is great potential there. The environments and the character models are quite polished. My PC allows me to run the game on the \\"Ultra\\" setting without hearing the fans kick in. It's great to be able to see a game how the developers meant for it to be seen. Unfortunately, the game is full of glitches that make the game unplayable. Whenever I kill an enemy, the body flies around the environment, shattering windows, alerting other enemies , etc. Tech support, if it were only a graphics glitch then it should not affect the environment or the AIs in it. It completely prevents me from being stealthy so I get gunned down quickly, or have a random dog fly through a wall and chew my arm until I die. Why are the dogs so deadly in this game?<br /><br />Also, why do I have to pay to upgrade my gear? It doesn't make any sense. The government wants me to track down and stop the terrorists. Why would the government not give me the tools to perform that duty for free? Do you want equipment that's going to keep you alive? Well, you have to buy it. You buy them with in-game currency that you receive for completing missions, which doesn't make sense either. I'm guessing Ubisoft intended to sell in-game items and upgrades for real money, but I didn't explore the upgrade system deep enough to see if it was a \\"pay to win\\" model.<br /><br />If I hadn't received this game free with my GTX 760, I would ask for a refund. It's not worth the aggravation.
