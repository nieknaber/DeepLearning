The mighty castle pack is a great addition to this game, lots of cards for only 9.99<br />This review is for the game itself not just the mighty castle pack.<br />I have played off and on for almost 3 years. This game is a lot of fun to play, and you can meet some great people.<br />some of the other reviews mentioned the need to buy crowns/tokens. I will say the game is playable without buying any tokens, but it is harder, and much more enjoyable to play as a premium player. This allows more researches and buildings to be done at one time. it also allows you to move buildings and little perks.<br />It goes off your IP so multiple computers in the same household can play the game, but you will not be able to send each other goods/troops etc. you can however usually find a faction member who will send goods for you, so its not actually that hard to do.<br />a warning though, the top players in this game do tend to spend a lot of money on the game and will always have an advantage to an extent, but like anything else money doesn't beat skill.<br />building villages, going to war, joining a faction and house are all great parts of this game, I highly recommend it. give it a try if you don't like it you didn't waste anything because its free to play, and if you are like me you will love it and spend way too much time on it.
