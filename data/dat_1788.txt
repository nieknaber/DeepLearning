It's like they took everything that was annoying about MMOs and *fixed* it. One character can do everything, no rolling alts to do different things unless you just want to. Really engaging crafting and gathering system, that are their own meta game with levels and gear. The storyline is breathtaking. If you're burnt out from WoW, this is definately a great place to land to start having fun again.
