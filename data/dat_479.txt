What you needs to know:<br /><br />Upgrade the pistols to the max level.<br />Once you can afford the plasma rifle, it's game over. Start upgrading that as much as you can from there, you can even beat the game on the last level with it.<br /><br />Don't waste your time with the machine gun or rocket launchers. The saw blade is only fun if you can maximize it to where it shoots 2 blades instead of one.<br /><br />This game is an absolute blast!
