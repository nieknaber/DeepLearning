This game is unplayable with DRM that prevents you from being able to launch the game unless servers are available. What should have been a revival of a classic is instead an exercise in futility and frustration as hour upon hour is wasted trying to make this game work. You are also unable to ever pass this game on due to the DRM. This game is an epic fail out of the gate and a dissapointment for someone that has been playing Sim City since the original version 20 some years ago.
