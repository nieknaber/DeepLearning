I bought this pack for two reasons - to help make better levels and have a few new ones to play around in. The only level in this pack is one where you pick up all the different prize bubbles at once... that's it. As you play through it, you see a brief overview of the movie. For $5, I was disappointed and hoped for something more than this. Now, I'm debating whether or not to buy the Marvel pack
