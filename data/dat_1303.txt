Pretty in Pink is a puzzle-type video game based on the 1986 movie of the same name.  For the most part, it consists of find-the-hidden-object puzzles, but it also has several find-the-difference-between-the-two-pictures puzzles, and a few brain teasers.  The plot of the game is presented with drawn characters with minimal movement, but at least follows the movie fairly faithfully.<br />Near the end of the game, you get to create a prom dress, based on various things you find in the game.<br />Where this games fails is in the gameplay.  I enjoy find-the-hidden-object games, but this one is pretty bad.  I played it on a 22-inch widescreen monitor, in full-screen mode, and still had trouble finding objects because they were very small.<br />There's also some poor hitbox planning.  On one screen, the last object that I had to find was a phone.  There was a large button covering part of the phone.  I kept clicking on the phone, but the game would not acknowledge it.  Eventually, i restarted the screen, and two of the objects I had to find were a button and a phone.  I clicked on the button (which covered part of the phone), and it disappeared (which is normal).  I clicked on the phone (which I had previously clicked on many times), and after the first click, the game acknowledged that I had found the phone.<br />The movie featured a great line up of songs.  This game featured incredibly poor &#34;MIDI&#34; type music, which sounded like the same two bars of music repeated over and over and over again.  Eventually, I gave up hoping for better music and just turned it off and started playing songs from my own MP3 collection.<br /><br />The best thing that I can say about this game is at least it didn't crash.
