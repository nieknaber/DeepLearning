Dozens of hours of game play with a huge world much bigger than the first.  Read the numerous online reviews for details on the game if you're unfamiliar but it's a solid improvement on the first game.  I will say that they have greatly scaled back the odds for finding the rarest items however which is starting to make the end game drag on a bit and become repetitive.  If you're not okay with farming and repetition though then you're probably in the wrong genre to begin with.<br /><br />I will say though this is a solid game with dozens of hours even if you just want to play through the story one time.
