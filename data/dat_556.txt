In terms of game play, I am amazed with this game. It combined all of the my favorite aspects of gaming. The realism of things, the introduction of different items and upgrades throughout the game and the clever way of handling both ranged and melee combat.<br /><br />I would very highly recommend this game to anybody who may be on the fence about purchasing it.
