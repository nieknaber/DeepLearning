I bought this for my mother who recently retired. She likes it. It's frustrating at times with a few of the puzzles. It has hint buttons and a notebook. You can skip puzzles; but, this will add 30 minutes to the game. The voice acting is very good. The doctor and sheriff sound just like the actors from the show, perhaps they are. Jessica sounds like Angela Lansbury, although I don't think it is her. Overall, it is a nice, interesting game.
