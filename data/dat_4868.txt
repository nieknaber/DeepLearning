After a month of trying to get these games to work (along with multiple driver downloads and reinstalls), contacting the game's support and loosing wads of my hair that I pulled out due to frustration I composed myself and finally contacted Amazon about this nightmare.  The rep. was very understanding and was gracious enough to offer his apologies.  He immediately offered a credit for the games.  Please purchase these games with the understanding that you have a strong chance of going through what I had the misfortune I had.  I have a quad core, 500gb hd DELL (brand new).
