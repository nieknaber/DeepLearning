I tried getting the game off Origins store page but it kept being stupid, just about gave up and a friend of mine told me that it was available on Amazon as either a Digital Download or boxed copy.. The lazy person i am just got the Download edition.<br /><br />As soon as the payment went through i was presented with the Serials for the game, and the premium edition expansion(s) on the order page. Entered them into the Origin client and began downloading..<br /><br />Total download size for Battlefield 3: Limited, + Premium Edition expansions is 28 Gigs<br /><br />Overall the game is great and i enjoy it, I've played it many times on the xbox and decided to get it for the PC, so it's not like i was new to the game or anything.
