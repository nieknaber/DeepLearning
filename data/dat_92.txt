What a piece of junk. I should have just looked at the stars and kept my twenty bucks. Not only do you have to install Origin, but also a browser plugin to launch the game. What really kills this game is gamepad support. Yes it sort of works, but you still need a keyboard and mouse for the mini challenges. Uninstalled after the first bit on the train. If you are going to say you support a controller then follow through.
