I thoroughly enjoyed Star Wolves 1.  Star Wolves 2 looked like it would be even better with a more open universe to explore.  Unfortunately it has several bugs.  The most serious problem I've encountered is that thus far I have not been able to dock my mother ship at any of the trading posts following completion of quests, so I have no way of upgrading my ship's equipment or of allocating my team's experience points.  Moreover, the game sometimes freezes up, requiring me to restart and go back to previous save point.  Also, there is a problem with ships getting \\"caught\\" on patrol stations and trading posts, but that can be avoided with careful gameplay.  Also, the voice acting for Ace is very poor.  I don't think the person reading the script was a very good reader -- he hesitates and pauses like he is trying to figure out what the script says.  I've never heard voice acting in a video game as bad as this.
