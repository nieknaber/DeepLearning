Farm Frenzy III is a good example of how the genre of time management or resource building games can go horribly wrong.  You could consider the popular Sims franchise as little more than a time management game except the world is open to you and there are so many things for you to do that you'll never be bored.  On the other hand, we have Farm Frenzy III...<br /><br />The object of Farm Frenzy III is to click on roughly the same space over and over and hope you have enough items in the warehouse to change item #1 into item #2 then to item #3 and so on.  You start off with these strange guinea birds that sound a lot like, well, chickens!  You collect their eggs so you can put them into a egg powder machine?  Then you make cookies from egg powder, then cakes?  In Africa?  Where you find, bears?  Does any of this make any sense at all?  Without even having played Farm Frenzy 1 and 2, I'm going to take a guess that the author shamelessly painted over the previous game to generate additional sales.  The eggs are still there but the chickens have become guinea birds, the cows have become that yak/wildebeast creature, and so on.<br /><br />The bigger problem is that, even if you enjoy the mind-numbing task of collecting eggs, then collecting egg powder, then cookies, a lot of times you don't know what to do with things because everything is so bizarre.  Ok I need string, apparently, but how do I get it?  I have to buy a yak/ox/wildebeast whatever it is.  Guess wrong and you're stuck for money and have to restart the level.  Options to buy other animals are available but you never know what their purpose is as you can never get enough money to buy them.  You can waste precious time hovering over buildings to figure out what each machine needs in order to operate, but not animals.  None of it really makes sense anyway.  I thought I was playing a game on a farm, not in a hut in Africa, with exploding dogs (!) where my friend has some really awful stereotypical caricatures.<br /><br />I wouldn't recommend it unless you like clicking on the same spot over and over like a rat banging on a food bar.  Then again, slot machine players may find something to like.  Nah, bad joke.  It's just no fun.  There's no way to really excel at the game unless we play the same level over and over but the game is so boring you just want to continue forward and get the game over with.<br /><br />Obviously, I don't recommend this game.  Instead, I would recommend you purchase the game [[ASIN:B001Q24UAM Play! The Ultimate Casual Game Collection]] as it contains the higher rated Farm Frenzy 2 as well as a number of other, similar games in this genre.mmend it unless you like clicking on the same spot over and over like a rat banging on a food bar.
