Set aside for the moment Arcania's reduction of the storied Gothic line of RPGs to a semi-linear 3D version of Diablo. Suffice to say this delayed stand-alone expansion (which sensibly drops the Gothic name entirely) is unlikely to win new converts. While I appreciate the impulse to follow up on loose ends, it doesn't improve on the parent game (which is comparatively open-ended), it feels short, the story and revisited characters are less than compelling, portions are weirdly lit and weirdly voiced and it's far, far too easy. The AI is still awful.  The bosses go down like so many sacks of potatoes -- often without striking a blow in their defense. Playing on \\"difficult,\\" I was able to kill the end-boss simply by perching on a distant slope (thus eluding all the conjured critters), easily dodging the occasional energy bolts hurled my way and  having at the demon with bow and arrow. No challenge at all. It was just an obligatory final task in a game that by then I no longer wanted to play.
