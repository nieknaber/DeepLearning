SONY's PS3 is now 5 years old whereas MICROSOFT's Xbox360 is 6 six years old.<br />\\"How is this relevant?\\" one would ask. It should not be, yet, sadly, it is.<br /><br />It is unfortunate that CRYSIS 2 has been designed and developed to run on hardware several Moore's Law cycles old. Remember how only umber-systems could run the original [[ASIN:B000PS2XDO Crysis]] on Ultra and PC magazines still use it to benchmark performance tests? Well, CRYSIS 2 is nothing like that. The good news of course is that now even older and less powerful systems can handle the new game; the bad news is that it does not matter - the graphics are nothing to write home about.<br /><br />FROM THE KOREAN JUNGLE TO (THE SIMPLER) NYC ONE<br />Foliage, rock formations, rivers, sandy beaches and crystal clear waters - all reflecting, refracting light and playing with shadows...remember how impressive the original game was? Well, I found the graphics to be a noticeable downgrade - and the urban environment nowhere near as demanding or as far drawn as those of the first CRYSIS.<br />To be fair, the graphics are not bad (in fact, they are above average), they are just not what one would expect from the sequel of the graphical masterpiece the original CRYSIS was. The closeup textures (yet strangely not floor surfaces) are more detailed but after so many years this minor improvement cannot outweigh the game's graphical disappointment.<br /><br />ONLY A PSEUDOSEQUEL<br />I consider this a pseudosequel because apart from the title on the box, there is very little that picks up the story from the original game. In fact, besides Prophet making a...5sec appearance, the only thing that acts as continuance is the NanoSuit - and even that has been consoled down (read: oversimplified). Alternating between stealth and shield is all there is to it now (gone are strength and speed). Also gone is the multitude of choices on how to approach the next objective. The sequel has you on a connect-the-dots path that is meaningless to deviate from.<br /><br />SOMEONE PLEASE CLUE CryTek THAT **LESS** ALIENS IS ACTUALLY BETTER<br />As in [[ASIN:B000EGOGAA Far Cry ]] so in [[ASIN:B000PS2XDO Crysis]], I barely tolerated the chapters where I had to fight Aliens. I mean, it would be unrealistic to expect great originality in a video game developed in the era of hydrocephalus corporations, so we end up with aliens that remind us of either the sentinels from THE MATRIX or the tripods from WAR OF THE WORLDS or some other movie. So, give it a rest. Trying to outwit humans and then besting them is much more satisfying.<br />And while we are on the subject, someone please explain to my how do humans infected with the alien virus become...bullet-proof? Anyone else notice that the billion-dollar NanoSuit is actually more vulnerable than infected flesh?<br /><br />AND THE DRM NEWS ARE NOT THE BEST EITHER<br />I expected EA to give us a choice: either an OnLine Activation or a perpetual disk-check. CRYSIS 2 does not come with a choice.
