Really fun 4 players split-screen game<br />the game is very easy to get into but requires some strategy and quick thinking to outsmart your opponents and kill them.<br />your objective is to kill your opponents with your arrows, they usually die with one hit unless they have the shield power-up. there are many arrow types and power-ups to be grabbed, also there are many options and mutators to change like auto balance that will give shield power up to the losing players..etc. highly recommended if you have enough buddies to play with.
