I purchased this bundle for less than a coffee at Starbucks. I never got to finish the first game but now that these and other titles are safe in the cloud I can enjoy Alma scaring the crap out of me. I played halfway through & had a blast. The A.I. was great at the time and as far as I know its the only game with a haunted office complex. Think Doom 3 meets HL Op For but with A.I. that really wants to kill you. Cheers!
