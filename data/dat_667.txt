The yearly membership is soooo expensive for the kids to play online with their friends. The X-Box is the gift that keeps on spending.<br /><br />But, I will say that purchasing the gold membership through Amazon is MUCH cheaper and a better deal. Will be using amazon for all future membership renewals. I never knew this was an option...glad I now know.
