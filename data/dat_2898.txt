I've played every Need for Speed game since the first one, and this version of Most Wanted wasn't too bad. The player can hop into any car available on the map (except for the ones that require money via DLC) and drive off, engaging in missions or running from the police. The graphics aren't too bad, but the physics engine is very arcadish not unlike the other NFS games. Unfortunately, technical issues like stuttering and horrible framerates really detract from the experience. I have an ATI HD Radeon 4870 that can run most games at a low resolution without any issues, but Most Wanted runs like a slug when there is a lot of motion/activity in the game. I tried keeping it capped at 30 fps, I tried removing the cap, I am running the latest version, etc... but the game is sluggish. I also play GTR, GTR2, GTR Evo, F1 2012, Borderlands 2, and a myriad of other games on this PC and everything flies. F1 2012 is absolutely glass smooth and that has a far more realistic physics engine. Need for Speed Most Wanted is just coded very poorly!<br /><br />The poor choice of cockpit views also makes me mad. The default perspective has your car taking up most of the view, and it is difficult to see ahead in traffic and for judging distances/steering when maneuvering around traffic. Going to the other cockpit view sends you into a very low to the ground nose camera, which is better for steering but I can't see much of the traffic ahead.<br /><br />The game also isn't fun when everything you run into causes a massive crash. The game isn't realistic to begin with, so why are they making a huge deal out of crashing especially when the intent of the game is to race illegally in a crowded city environment?<br /><br />Forza Horizon did an outstanding job of racing through traffic... The graphics are insanely good, even on an Xbox 360, the framerate is stutter free, and the driving physics is great - and crashes aren't as big of a deal so the fun factor is kept high. If the Need for Speed franchise wants to survive beyond bargain bin gaming, they need to look at what their competitors are doing.<br /><br />Overall: 2/5 stars. Could have been a really fun game, but the technical problems combined with a poor selection of cockpit views detracts from the fun factor. Luckily I picked up this game for 5 bucks, and even then I don't feel it was worth this amount.anchise wants to survive beyond bargain bin gaming, they need to look at what their competitors are doing.<br /><br />Overall: 2/5 stars.
