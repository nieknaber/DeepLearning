I bought this a month ago and I still cant play the game. After you download the entire 30 gbs, once you hit play in Steam it says failed to connect to key server.<br /><br />DONT BUY THIS GAME UNTIL THIS IS FIXED.<br /><br />This has been going on for a whole month.<br /><br />I wil update this review once this is fixed by either Rockstar/Amazon/Steam.
