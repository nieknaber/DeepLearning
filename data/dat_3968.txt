My favourite game of all time. I remember spending several nights playing and re-playing this game. So many places to visit, so many different choices to make - replay value is virtually unlimited. Awesome humor - I would say genre-defining. Awesome atmosphere - sound, sights, behavior; you can almost feel yourself in the Wasteland. Interesting quests.<br /><br />Pros:<br />- Atmosphere<br />- Humor<br />- Easy to learn and control<br />- FUN!<br />- Takes days to explore the game<br />- True RPG where your choices influence the game<br /><br />Cons:<br />- Only turn-based combat<br />- Graphics, although awesome for the time, now would seem outdated<br />- Addicting
