Way Better than the second game it actually feels like they put some time into it.  The story over all is good and the characters in your party are well written.  The main thing that prevented the game from being a 5 star is it's lack of diversity in the skills you can get as you level up and no real attribute point allocation.  Sure you get more attribute points by selecting the passive skills in the trees but still watered down compared to the first Dragon Age.  But still way better than the second game.
