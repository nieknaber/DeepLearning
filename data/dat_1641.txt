Its just ok. My gripe with the game is that since its a retro style game, it shouldve had all of its strong points in story, game-play, and solid control functionality. But it seems like all of the things many 8 bit games got right more than 30 years ago, Devolver said &#34;meh, whatever. Just make it $10 bucks.&#34; If this game was solid in all categories I wouldve gladly paid $30-$40. But Im glad I got it on sale and used some gift card credit. The concept fo the game is solid. Most of the execution is solid. But the certain parts that dont work properly really give it a rushed, cheap feel. Its something that I didnt expect from Devolver. I bought this right after playing through Shadow Warrior (one of the greatest games made of the past 10 years). So I expected this to be structurally as solid as Shadow Warrior. Its not and I dont know what all the rave was about this game. If you want a retro looking game that is worth the price, try Gunpoint. There are others that fit into this genre that are around the same price that are also much better.
