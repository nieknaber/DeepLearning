People who gave this game a bad review probably only spent a day, maybe two days playing this game, and then making a determination that TSW (The Secret World) was boring, garbage, BS, and every curse word that would shame a sailor. Any MMO review that's based on a few hours of game time are best left alone, in fact, it shouldn't even be called a review...call it more of a whining episode.<br /><br />Let me start off by saying that this game is NOT EASY. I've been subbing to this game since it first came out. And yes, for those so-called &#34;MMO Experts&#34; whose only experience was WOW (horrible kiddie MMO), they will find themselves in a bit of a bind. This is not a WOW clone. This is not for those so-called &#34;MMO experts&#34;. This game requires lots of planning on your build, and lots of patience...oh and lots of death.<br /><br />For starters this game is brutal. As soon as you enter Kingsmouth (first area in TSW), you will get mobbed, torn-apart, and left on the wayside by about...I'd say five maybe eight zombies because you were running around like Julie Andrews on Sound of Music thinking the aggro range is short.Think again...the mobs here have a very long aggro range.<br /><br />Game setting is modern day. So there are no elves, dwarfs or fairies. What you get are zombies, mutants, humans, and more zombies. There are mansions and houses to explore, caves, bridges, forests, even car wrecks, there are junkyards, gas stations and restaurants.<br /><br />Then there's the matter of building your skills. The beauty of this game is that it doesn't have any levels. Yup no levels. Zero levels. In other words, this game has no level cap because simply put, there's no levels. What you get are skill points and ability points that you invest depending on your build, or whatever suits your playstyle. Yes there's still the using tank, dps, healer formula but it all depends on how you build yourself. You can be tank and heal, range and heal, the list goes on. What youhave as skills are based on the type of weapon you use...Hammer, Fist, Shotgun, Assault Rifle, Sword, Elemental, Chaos, and other weapons. Each weapon has its own set of active abilities and passive abilities. You level these abilities whenever you earn ability points (AP). At the same time, you level your skill also based on your weapon. I am playing a Fist Weapon and Sword...so I put points in my weapons using skill points. Then within those weapons, you earn ability points which you then pick and choose from a list of passives and actives. I use a lot of heal skills so I get to solo on my own. Soloing is possible in this game, but you have to pick and choose your quests. There's also the matter of dying in the game. When you die, you become a &#34;soul&#34; and you have to go back to your body to resurrect yourself. This is old-school death penalty.<br /><br />Long story short, if you are used to the kindergarten structure of WOW, then you will have a hard time getting into this game. You have to let go of your kiddie MMO experience, keep and open mind, and then dive into one of the most mature MMO game in the industry. There are no dragons or castles or elves in this game. No made up language or worlds. There's NY, London, and another modern city. You are either a Templar, Illuminati, or Dragon clan. Lots of HP Lovecraft, Area 51, and Bigfoot , and other conspiracy theories, all part of the entire game world.<br /><br />Get this game, open your mind, and experience a whole different MMO.
