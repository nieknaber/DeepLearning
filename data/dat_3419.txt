Right up front I have to admit that I gave this game one more star than I might have based on the originality of the concept. There are only a few games based on fairy tales that I know of, and I would never have thought the Pied Piper would be in that number.<br /><br />The game starts after the children have been led away from town, and your role is to find them and bargain with the Pied Piper for their return. In the first half of the game you must collect coins, some from the townspeople and some hidden in various locations.<br /><br />Now here's where the oddly enough part comes in. The few people you interact with all have strange reasons they can't just fork over their coins to you. One guy is afraid of his angry cat, the baker is on the verge of a nervous breakdown because he has a gargoyle on his roof, and the blacksmith seems to be suffering from narcolepsy. The result is that you have to work hard to get all those coins, passing through 3 environments, two in and around the town, and one that for some reason is an abandoned circus. In each you are going back and forth between a few houses or areas, tnough when you are through with the environment there is no backtracking.<br /><br />There's some interaction with inanimate objects like a stove, and the game manages to also sneak in some steam punkery, not surprising since the same company also has the Snarkbuster games.<br /><br />The second part of the game involves getting in to meet with the Pied Piper. This to me, is where it starts to become dull. Finding the children and dealing with the Pied Piper take a backseat to a lot of somewhat pointless activity.<br /><br />For a hidden object game, there are actually few HO scenes, or mini puzzles for that matter. The HO scenes are all of the find the fragment variety, and even if you dislike that as much as I usually do, it's still o.k. because the fragments are all of a decent size and well drawn enough that you can find them before becoming frustrated. The mini games are all super easy. I liked the ones in the circus section the best, including one game where you have to figure out how to shoot cannon balls at the sun. All other objects you need to complete various tasks are found hidden in the environments as you go through the game.<br /><br />This is a solid, if slightly pedestrian entry from Alawar.
