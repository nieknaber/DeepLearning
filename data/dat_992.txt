I was immensely excited for a NASCAR game to FINALLY come out for PC but I feel like this is just another big game publisher exploiting the fandom of \\"insert-sports-genre-here\\" for profit. NASCAR The Game 2013 feels very broken and unfinished. From jittering cars during caution laps, to the AI literally racing THROUGH THE INFIELD, game crashing everytime I try to pit and don't even get me started on the paint shop.... I was only able to dive into the game after spending HOURS with steam support trying to troubleshoot why my XBox 360 controller wouldn't work with the game; despite it's claims of having \\"Full Controller Support.\\" I finally discovered that the device drivers of my keyboard were conflicting with my game controllers drivers and the only way to play the game was for me to disable my keyboard in the device manager. I would also like to add that prior to purchasing this game that my XBox 360 controller worked with many racing games including GRiD, Dirt 2, MotoGP 2013, TrackMania, every Need For Speed game that I own and many many more. It is only with NASCAR The Game 2013 that I have encountered all of these problems. I give this game a big fat \\"meh..\\" It needs work... badly. This game has so much potential but I would strongly suggest against buying this game. The graphics look great and the controls weren't to bad but the bugs and game crashes rendered the game completely unenjoyable for me. Maybe next years version will be a little more polished.<br /><br />UPDATE: After a month of testing and work on a new patch the developers barely fixed the AI, didn't fix ANY bugs and created even more. They have proven to myself and many others that they are incapable of fixing the issues that exist with this game. I strongly urge interested buyers against buying this title.
