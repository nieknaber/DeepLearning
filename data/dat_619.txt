unfortunately i cannot give this item a fair review since this pc could not play it. i do like the instant download alot saves time and money...what i did like is that since i was not able to play it i got the tropico reloaded with tropico 2 for 6.99 and it works fine :) i believe tropico 3 is probably alot of fun! what i am not crazy about is i like easy to use interface and nice and easy tutorials i have played mucho macho for years and i love it easy to use interface and stat checks and visuals. so if u love tropico i am sure u will not be disappointed but u may have to get use to a new way to play it...i did get to play in on an online site and was confused...but then again that is easy to do (LOL)
