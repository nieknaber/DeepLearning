Sense my love for this game, i downloaded it with out hesitation.  A few problems showed, causing this rating.  1  Checksum error was one 2 Upon execution of the game it just sat there and done nothing. ya i heard sound, but it didn't bother to launch the game.  I am sure i would run it to other problems.  Just a shame it had to be this.  I'd play the game with mild problems.  Can't even play it, no display.  ugh.<br /><br />I am running os x 10.8 as for the system req.  I am also running an intel quad core.  Not on the req.  With a standard mac display video card.  4 gb ram.  All this should be part of system req..
