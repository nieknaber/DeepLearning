Great game with pretty good graphics. I really hated the auto-adjusting camera angles sometimes; especially when climbing or scooting against walls. Swimming was also a pain, but overall I really enjoyed the game and plan to buy another. I did have to buy a controller. I couldn't get the hang of using the keyboard for movement.
