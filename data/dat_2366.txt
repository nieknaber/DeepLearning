The games graphics are wonderful, at least what I saw but there is nothing like an arrow or hand or pointer to let you know where you are from the opening page. Now you can choose there because the choices are in a row and they light up when you are over them but nothing else. How are suppose to know when you are over anything, now that is messed up. how are you going to click on an object when you do not know if you are over it?
