I played the game when it first came out & it was included when you got a new computer.  I sort of struggled with it until my kid got a hold of it and had it mastered  in a few weeks.  By watching him play, I learned to play it enough so I can win most of the times when the settings are not too difficult.  I like that there are so many parameters to consider whenever you build or settle different types of land, or even the types of settlers you choose.  Makes you think before you click.  Still haven't done the hardest type of settings, though.  It's a great game of strategy and planning while your competitors are doing the same thing.
