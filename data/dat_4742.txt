Well, this seemed to be a classic alien shoot em up game with some nice guns and unique features. Destructible environments, which also repairable. I had the graphics settings maxed out with 1080p and dont know why it would make my radeon hd 5770 slow down a bit in some areas and it shouldn't.The graphics shouldn't warrant a higher end card. It looks a bit cartoony and kind of looks like the Unreal engine  from doom 3, a little more polished but not much. Graphics should be better. It is fun to play. seemed like an old school game but i welcome those games. Wouldn't pay more than $15. I bought it for $4 and some change. Oh yeah! this game download did not want to work. I tried everything and nothing. it installed perfectly, got a menu , but as soon as I launched, i got a Blue screen of death. I had to download the game from a different site and that copy worked flawlessly. BEWARE! this is a STEAM game. I had to get a another copy that wasn't steam in order to play it on my computer. there are no patches for this game as I write this. And yes, I do have a steam account.<br /><br />AMD FX 8120 overclocked to 3.6ghz  32C - under game load<br /><br />XFX Radeon HD 5770.<br /><br />8 Gigs of 1600 RAM
