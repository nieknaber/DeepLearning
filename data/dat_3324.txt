They did not care to fix gun sounds, they still all sound the same. SMGs dominate the game, there is no reason to hold down sight anymore when everyone just hip fires. Maps are small and spawns are horrible. Feels like you are thrown in a small arena just so you can be shot in the back 20 times. Graphics are worse than the modern warfare series. This is coming from an original cod, mw2 and mw3 player with a consistent 2.40+ ratio. This game is just bad
