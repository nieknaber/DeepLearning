I bought European Escalation and really never got into it a couple of years ago. I wasn't expecting much when it came to ALB, I expected pretty much the same, wow, was I wrong. This game has depth in spades, with the amount of nations and units available, it's simply amazing. I don't play online, I bought this game to play against the AI and I must say no two games are alike. You have tremendous strategy to employ, a feature that a lot of new RTS games are missing is the ability direct you AI partner, i.e., toss a flare down and ask for aid and they will send forces to your rescue. I loved this aspect in the last Red Alert, though the expansion for it removed this aspect, completely ruining a lot of the experience IMO. Simply put, this game is exceptional - I can't say enough good things about it. If you are a fan of modern warfare or you like large scale games such as Total Annihilation or the original Supreme Commander, you no doubt will highly enjoy this game. My only thing I would like to see change is balancing the nations and improving the overall sound quality. Nothing wrong with the sound, for the most part it's incredible, though I would like to see less compression and purer audio quality.<br /><br />I would like to see a paid expansion possibly bringing in the last 20 years of technology and/or Asian Countries - maybe, &#34;Asian Escalation&#34; North & South Korea, China, Japan, India etc. The NATO and PACT weapons are from late 1950's until around 1991 or so (Cold War), would like to see this expanded to present day.<br /><br />Red Dragon can't get here soon enough
