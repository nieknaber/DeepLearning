I used to play this game a TON.  Jungle Quest appears to be unique among match 3 games because I think the programming underneath is actually done better, leading to superior game play compared to all other match 3 games (which I will explain).<br /><br />Take for example this common problem, which arises in Candy Crush Saga: When you play a timed level in Candy Crush, it is frustrating because you often want to make a move, but you have to wait for other things to drop.<br /><br />In Jungle Quest, after you complete a group of 3, it is possible for you to swap other tiles before the animation completes and new tiles drop.  This means you can swap stuff as quickly as you can see them, making it really fun.  From a technical standpoint, this suggests that the code underneath is multithreaded.  Multithreaded programming is very hard, which is why the other match 3 games don't allow this.<br /><br />As you play each level, you can earn mana which allows you to cast a spell that affects the game board.  Although 5 spells are available, you can only choose among 3 spells (each of which requires a certain amount of mana), and when you cast a spell, you use all of your mana.  This makes your use of spells strategically interesting and you can feel like you really accomplished something when you use your spells wisely.<br /><br />Timed targets are provided for you to earn bronze, silver, and gold medals.  For a true challenge, try to earn a gold medal on absolutely every level.  The ultimate level, and I really mean THE ULTIMATE LEVEL, is the last level.  I am *proud* to say that I earned a gold medal on the very last level, and I only did it once after playing that level hundreds of times.  Seriously, you might believe even a silver medal is impossible, but I can assure you that a gold medal is indeed possible if you have the perfect game.
