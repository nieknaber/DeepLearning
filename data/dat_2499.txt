After a successful download, the game continually freezes, is off center and causes my new Netbook to \\"black-screen\\" for a few seconds.  I purchased two other digital downloads the same day I purchased this one on Amazon, and I can play them fine.  Also, I'm having problems trying to return/exchange this game. There seems to be no option for help on this.
