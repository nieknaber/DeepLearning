This game has so much potential. I wish it was larger as you feel super limited, you can't build that many buildings in it and the map is so small that you'll have a basic town at best to work with. Also the algorithms for things such as trash, money, fires etc. are all out of whack. It seems purely random that you'll have a successful city or a bad city. Civ5 for example has issues also with its AI but at least it gets the building part correct in terms of how buildings should react with economy etc.
