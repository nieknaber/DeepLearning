This is DOOM on your Xbox360.  Everything works great and it actually feels good to play it this way.  Of course this is a 15 year old FPS, so you should not expect awesomness compared to the newer games, however it is everything you remember from your previous plays.    I found the multiplayer to be a little sparse as there are few players still playing it, and I found the multiplayer to not be fun for this reason.  However someone else may like it.
