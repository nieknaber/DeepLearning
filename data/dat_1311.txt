I love this game! Great story, great in game quests that keep you interested and make your actually want to read/listen to the NPC's and watch the cinematics. Questing is never boring, gameplay is fun, but the best thing is the augmented reality quests. These quests require you to do research, web searches and actually investigate in order to find solutions. In many situations the company creates entire websites that provide links to clues on the web. For an example try visiting the website for the imaginary town of Kingsmouth, Maine. the website is www dot kingsmouth dot com (entered this way so Amazon doesn't block the address)<br /><br />Give it a try, you won't be disappointed.
