This expansion is fun - you get to go to work with your sims and it makes it a bit more fun then just hanging out with them at home all the time. I did find the police job a bit confusing at first as things as not as well explained. I would have given five stars had EA games included toddlers but that is a complaint I will have with all expansions until the bring them back!
