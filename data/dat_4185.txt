I'm an adult and I love this program!  It's very childish, but that's OK with me.  The fact that the words are read aloud by the program is an advantage.  As I type my answer I hear an annoying voice reading each letter as I type it and after I get the correct answer I hear cheers.  Those things are a little annoying to me as an adult.  I type well and those things slow me down a little bit.  I wish I knew the total number of words in the program and how they were selected.
