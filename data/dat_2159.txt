I grabbed one of these when they were on sale.<br /><br />I had an email with the code within 3 minutes.<br /><br />For comparison, I bought another code from another company at the same time (I didn't realize Amazon had the sale too) and it took a day or more to get the code emailed to me. That is ridiculous for something digital and for the largest video game retailer out there.
