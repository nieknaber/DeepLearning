The battles are sort of hard to control, i would say half the time i just resolve them statistically because they are hard to control and to see whats going on.  I would say this is just a more detailed and war type version of Civilization.  It isn't a bad purchase, however it isn't my favorite nor is it worth 30 dollars.  I would have been happy paying only 20 dollars for this game due to some issues.  If you do not own civilization, i would recommend purchasing that over this game.<br /><br />Some of the icons are a bit silly, also, the characters you select for battle are not very easily understood.  The pictures all look the same so you have to select the icon and read what unit it is you have, the pictures should have the major weapon or form of transport so you can at a glance see what you are doing.  I would prefer a better battle pre-set up so you can just set your formations and send the entire battle group in rather than having to babysit an entire army.
