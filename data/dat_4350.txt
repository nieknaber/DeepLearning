From the 4x games I've played, the most similar game would be Galactic Civilization 2, a great 4x game in itself, in both its gameplay and background. If you already like GalCiv 2, this game should be right up your alley.<br /><br />Its execution and amount of content on the usual 4x elements range from good to great. There are 8 races, lots of civic options (buildings/improvements), research options, and a little weaker on diplomacy. Several victory conditions that cater to different play style.<br /><br />While some say the battle is merely a \\"card game\\", it needs to be considered in the context of 4x, in which the strategy is determined and executed *before* the battle, i.e. having a strong production or producing the right unit for the situation. Not to mention, in most 4x games, the combat involve little besides dragging units to the desired location.<br /><br />The only thing I find really lacking is the UI, which gets really cumbersome as your empire grows larger. It needs to do better to preset both information and access to users to manage large number of systems (equivalent of planets or cities). For example, there is no GalCiv 2 style production manager, meaning towards the end you'll be clicking thru 20-30 systems to build x. Hot keys are curiously missing--as in none at all.<br /><br />All in all, a great strategy, 4x game that could use a better UI.
