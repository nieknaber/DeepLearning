The game was installed and ran smoothly on my Windows 7 64-bit.     My complain is that some dialogs of the peasants repeat without any change (i.e. the same sentence is repeated each time you talk to him), but this is understandable as otherwise the game would need a lot more dialogs than now (like in Mass Effect 2). Also the game needs an \\"toggle always run\\" button (which makes the character run non-stop).    Overall though the game is great. I haven't finished playing but so far the stories, cinematic, and combat are all amazing.
