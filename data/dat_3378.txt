Sonic Generations is a fun game that redeems the Sonic franchise of its status for putting out pitiful games of late.  The game was designed to and succeeds in bringing back a sense of nostalgia with its classic gameplay.  Each stage has 2 acts, where the first act lets you use classic Sonic in a 2-D environment and the second stage lets you use modern Sonic in a 3-D environment, but the ultimate goal is the same... to get to the end of the level.  Both classic and modern Sonic control slightly differently and can both be equipped with unique unlockable abilities (such as being able to stop on a dime and starting a level with 10 rings instead of 0).  The game has an emphasis on speed(it's a Sonic game after all), but at the same time the player needs to be patient and observe the area at times so the player won't run haphazardly into any danger.  There are some frustrating parts at times, but none of them feel cheap... just usually the player's fault by either rushing through too fast or mistiming a jump.<br /><br />Overall the game should take about 6-8 hours to complete depending on your skill level.  The game has plenty of extra challenges for each level including racing an opponent and collecting a certain number of rings before finishing.  You will have to do some of the challenges in order to actually unlock the bosses, but you are allowed to pick and choose and some are easier than others.  Each challenge also has a high scorer's list if you are into setting records.  Also the game has a plethora of unlockable items such as remixed songs from older Sonic games, and concept art.  If you are a fan of Sonic, whether it is the Sonic of Genesis days or the fan of the modern Sonic games then Sonic Generations is a game I would wholeheartedly recommend for you
