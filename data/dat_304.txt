Coming from the lines of Cake Mania (sorta) is this game, Flower Shop.  If you love the games where you are serving customers, yet are looking for something a bit more original than the same game over and over in different venues, then I highly recommend this one!  It's original, fast paced without being too stressful, and has excellent, colorful graphics. I've been hoping and hoping that they would come out with a second one... but to no avail!  This one seems a bit less known than others, which really surprises me... it's one of my favorites.
