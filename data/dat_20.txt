Having grown up with the franchise, SimCity has a special place in my heart. I spent countless hours with SimCity, then SimCity 2000. Based on the advertised features and reviews, I had high hopes for SimCity (2013).<br />Unfortunately, even two days after release, the game will not connect to EA servers, even after long waits for the \\"next connection attempt\\" (and waits of multiple hours to even get to that stage).<br />The value of this game is therefore mostly in its pretty box (unless you have the download version).<br /><br />EA, in its greedy attempt prevent a few pirated copies by requiring the game to be constantly connected and failing to set up adequate infrastructure for this connection has killed PC gaming's oldest, best franchise.<br />After many disappointments, SimCity was the last chance I was going to give EA as a customer. At this point I don't see myself buying another EA game, no matter what game that may be.
