I downloaded this for my 8YO. He thinks it's great. You have to teach your villagers how to survive or they die. They even create babies. At first I was a bit concerned, you just drop a boy on a girl, they go in a hut and a few seconds later an announcement is made that the stork has brought a baby.     Actually, just watching this I became bored very quickly, but I'm not much of a video game player. Kids seem to like being in charge and this game gives them that.
