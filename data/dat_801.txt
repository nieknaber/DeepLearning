This is a handy feature to have in the game, it lets you fully edit your starting ruler. However, the key here is that it is *only* your starting ruler. Anyone who has played this game knows that your ruler can literally die within 5 minutes of starting your game from a random event.<br /><br />You can change your appearance, set your own name, and create your own Dynasty. You can also customize your coat of arms for your dynasty.<br /><br />The final thing you can edit, and the real meat of this editor, are your rulers traits. You get to pick and choose from any of them in the game, and almost all of them have either a cost or a credit to your rulers age. Give yourself too many bonuses and you'll start the game as a very old man and not expect to live very long. It's almost a game in itself of trying to decide which negatives to give yourself so that you can start at a resonable age while keeping in mind that your traits can be passed down to your heirs.<br /><br />A caution is that you start all by yourself. You have no one else up the line in your dynasty or any brothers/sisters. You can have a wife and/or children (at a cost to your age) from the editor, but no one else in the family. This means you will not have any claims on any lands at the start. As an example of a popular start, choosing Dublin in Ireland will in a normal game have you as the heir to the County of Leinster which you often get quite early as he is your father and starts the game old. However, if you customize your ruler you are no longer his son and thus do not inherit that title on his death.<br /><br />It's a very nice feature, but something so basic I really feel it should have been included in the game rather than as additional paid content. I recommend waiting for a 75% off sale before buying.
