Having played the original version of this game i was hoping that the remastered one would be just as good if not better, but to me it wasn't! It had stupid little annoying tasks and puzzles you had to do and the game was VERY SHORT! I prefer the original game much better! Ever since the Haunted Carousel, the Nancy Drew games have changed and never been the same, and to me not as good!<br />If you find it on sale for six bucks or less then maybe buy it,other wise i would advise you to not waste your money.
