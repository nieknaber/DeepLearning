Great game until my account got hacked two weeks after launch, since then I've had no response from SE at ALL about getting my account UN-suspended. What's sad is that I really enjoyed the game and was quite possibly the best MMO experience I've had. It's as if they could care less about you once you've bought their product, I even waited in a queue for 2.5 hours to chat with someone and all they could say was that my situation sucked and it would be passed on to the next level. That was a month ago. Boo Square Enix!!!
