There are so many bad reviews from people complaining about the stability, or lack thereof, of the servers.  They have a right to complain and it is quite an irritating situation, but in a few short days all of this will be behind us and yet all the 1 star reviews will persist.<br /><br />This review is not about that, I am lucky enough to be able to log into a server and play the game regularly, so I have experienced quite a bit of the game myself with minimal server issues (aside from the first day).  Once you get into the game and start playing, it really is entertaining and addictive, and has the potential for fun co-op multiplayer city building.<br /><br />Things I've enjoyed so far:<br />- Experimenting with different city designs and watching the cause and effect of my decisions in the simulation.<br />- Strategically building cities that complement each other, and then being suprised and challenged when the citizens don't behave how I would like, they behave more like stubborn humans than sims.<br />- Watching the GlassBox engine run, its quite fun to sometimes sit there and just watch the city operate.<br /><br />Things I haven't enjoyed:<br />- Requires online to play.  I can't defend this because its a cheap tactic used by EA to stop piracy, seems to have backfired against them anyways.<br />- Server stability, this will be resolved within days, it is already significantly better than launch day.  I'm personally not too bothered by offline servers, cause I have plenty of other things to do and have the patience to come back in a few hours when its back up.<br />- GlassBox simulation engine bugs.  Its not a perfect simulation engine by far, there are weird quirks that will hopefully be fixed soon.  Things that make my city shut down because certain systems aren't behaving properly.  The city simulation is very fragile and when one thing doesn't function properly, it has a snowball effect.<br /><br />My advice: Wait a week or two, until the server issues have been resolved.  It is a good game still and I have a lot of fun when I get to play it.
