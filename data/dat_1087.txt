I used to have this game a long time ago, so when I found it again I downloaded it.  The darn thing doesn't work on my computer, maybe its crappy download, maybe not, it was supposed to be compatible with Windows 7, its not. The game either froze up to the point that I had to power off my computer (using the power button, not the start menu) or while playing the game, it would randomly kick me out of the game, and then I would lose my progress, and then it would freeze up my computer. Don't waste your money.
