There are some really bad bugs/faults that EA just won't fix. Pretty disappointing. The game is definitely playable, and the best football game available... but I wish people cared about the quality of their product rather than just money. The game has been out a while and the EA don't seem to be in any rush to fix the issues that have been present since the launch in September 2014.  But at the end of the day, I suppose it's just a silly first world problem... &#34;I'm not happy with the way my $60 game plays on my $1000 laptop&#34; lol.
