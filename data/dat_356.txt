First of all, the story is pretty good (it starts a little slow) and it engages you, you see many classic Batman villain and acquire a nice set of gadgets, however, there are things that really bugged me, such as the inconsistent multiplayer, it is nearly impossible to find players on that matchmaking system, the only way to play multiplayer (as of right now) is to get friends who also play it and do private matches.<br />Another thing, the most criticized one, is the fact that the game has MANY bugs, crashes etc. which have not been addressed in their entirety.<br />All in all, i give it 3/5, if the bugs with multiplayer and single player were ironed out, it could easily get 4/5.
