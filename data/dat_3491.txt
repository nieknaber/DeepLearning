First let me say I am not a true gamer.  I can only compare this to Dishonored.  I like the graphics and all the things Batman can do.  I like the overall game, but I would like it if I had more control with the gamepad, instead of hitting a button and just watching Batman glide and kick, or climb by running into something and it is automatic.  In Dishonored the controls interface better with the actions of the character and are thus more realistic. I like the takedown mode and the grappling hook.  I dont like it that the inmates have automatic weapons and all Batman can do is grapple away to relative safety and move around until the inmate lets his guard down again for a kick or takedown.
