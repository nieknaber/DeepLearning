Ok I have WoW, DIABLO3, TORCHLIGHT2, BF3, NEED FOR SPEED WORLD, BIOSHOCK 1 and 2, Metro2033 lots of current games np on the installs !!!! Tried to install every game in this bundle.. Gives me a gaming manager download on the install and no desktop icon after the install is over.. went to c drive for the program folder and then amazon games folder to try to find a startup icon for all, accept one game that placed an icon on my desktop \\" pro-street\\" gave me an ddsetup something and then went into reg install mode like all the other games in the install.. and the ddsetup stopped working pressed cancel.. clicked on the desktop icon said cannot find please reinstall.. Oh they uninstall just fine but take forever and a day both on the install and the uninstall..  Not one of these games installed properly and the only thing I can think of is who the hell paid these people off in leaving these reviews !!!<br /><br /> Specs<br /> Windows Vista 32 sp2<br /> 8gb Komputerbay gaming ram 1600 oc'd 1700+<br /> 3.3 ghz phenom black edition oc'c 3.780<br /> xfx 6770 xfire<br /><br /> WTH happened to icons on the desktop after installing games even steam has that option !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Please if anyone has had this issue and got these games to install let me know.. You'd be taking a chance downloading this bundle for sure.. I'm a long time gamer and know for sure there's something seriously messed up with this download and these games aren't installing right at all!! The reviews are rather disturbing considering what I've experienced trying to figure out what I'm doing wrong.. Went too Amazons purchases items page to see if I couldn't return the download.. I've yet found a way to get help either from need for speed or amazon in regards to this digital download.. Please take this review seriously... if you feel like taking the chance go ahead but man right now I'm out 32.00 dollars and no answers...
