This game is vast. Like, Scary vast. It has a wonderful art style that I find tasteful even today. The community is extremely kind and are always working together. Classes are diverse. World vs World is extremely fun, and the side quests are enjoyable. The world is ever-changing and offers a rich and immersive story. My only complaint is with the genre in general and that can't be held against this beautiful game.
