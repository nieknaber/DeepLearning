DO NOT WASTE YOUR HARD EARNED CASH ON THIS GAME !!!  Yes, it saddens me to no end to have to start my review this way, but it is true.  Keep playing BC2, BF2, or 1942.  This is the worse release and consitinued support of any game in history.  Its how NOT to design, release and support a PvP game.  1. This game was never ready, nor is still ready for release. Bugs, server crashes, exploits ect.  2. DICE is the worst software development team in the world. If they were not, they would have at least fixed some of these issues. Instead, they are making thing even worst.  3. DICE, instead a dealing, with making their software playable, ie. not crashing every time, is spending their time nerfing good weapons, and not dealing with issues that should be fixed, (i.e the MAV, firing motrtars from inside buildings).  4. Hackers, Exploits and everything else your mind could envision just add to othe frustartion of this game. Again, DICE = NO SHOW !!!  In summary, I think someone needs to start a Class Action Suite against them. That is the only thing companies like this understand. I for one would be joining the lawsuit.
