Visuals, music, mechanics and the overall gameplay of Hotline Miami is insanely fun, insane and incredibly addictive. While some levels may come more naturally to you, you must be prepared to face failure and frustration time and again. It combines careful planning with sheer recklessness and rewards ingenuity. If you're into top down shoot-em-ups or even if you aren't, this is a game worth playing.
