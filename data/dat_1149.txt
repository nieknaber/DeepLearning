This is and incredible conversion of THE Mortal Kombat! I think MK2 was the best (and still rocks) from the series, and this version has it all: sound fx, music, etc. The things that holds it back a little is the lack of a command list, as well the graphics. Not that they are bad, but they could have upgraded a little.
