I've bought this game a few weeks ago, I've played this game on my play station awhile back, and on my computer, it is so laggy. Like. It's extremely bad and I am extremely upset. I really want my money back because at times its lagging so much that It's shut down on its own and lost a lot of my progress. I almost had to start all the way over. The music at the beginning lags so much you can't even tell its music. It sometimes doesn't lag and that's great. But yesterday I was going down a slide and she jumped off of it and flew to the side and fell through 5 levels of the game and floated in darkness. I could jump and float and dodge but nothing else. And then all of a sudden her health goes completely away and it kicks me back to way before where I was.
