I'm mainly into JRPGs but I thought I'd give this one a shot because I was pretty bored. There are a few starting options (human, dwarf, elf, mage, etc), but I only played one of them and didn't even bother finishing it. The story is okay, but not thrilling to me. The controls and battles can feel like an annoyance at times as I didn't seem to have the type of precision I would have liked. Plus your allies seem to not be very bright as they'll just walk right in front of you while you're casting your big spell, and if you have friendly fire on they can take quite a beating.<br /><br />I think they intended the game to have a lot of replay values with all the different starting and configuration options, but, from what I can tell, the stories don't differ THAT much between them (mainly the starting and endings are different, but the middle gameplay is very similar).
