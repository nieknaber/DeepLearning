If your like me and owned a sega genesis back in the 90's and your after a cheap legal way to relive these classic games, then this is the product for you. the emulation is not 100% perfect but its close enough and i never found the few errors i saw to be an issue, there is a nice menu to choose your games from and you can save/load at any point in the game. there are pdf file manuals included, i dont think they are exact copies of the original realease manuals, but they tell you what you need to know. i have a playstation 2 controller running via usb on my laptop and the game acepted this fine. all up i think it is excelent value, but if you dont care about the legal issue or you need 100% perfect emulation your better of with an illegal rom and emulator
