I held off buying these two games when they first came out because of bad reviews, figured I'd wait to maybe try them later as their prices came down. With this great package from Amazon, the price was more than right to give them a try and I'm very glad I did. Max Payne 3, while it may be kinda quick in gameplay, I did enjoy the plot of the game and the storyline. LA Noire, all I can say is...WOW, love it. It puts you in the world of the GTA style games but this time, you are the LAW, and you have to progress up the ranks in the LAPD during the golden age of Hollywood. The world is open but the missions are very good giving you options which affect how the game will play out. This game is one of Rockstar's gems and I can only hope they develop a followup at some point. If you don't have either of these games, you gotta pick up this set through Amazon, can't beat the price and the games are well worth it!
