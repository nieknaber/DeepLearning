Single player is fun, but the game really shines in the online play.  Online is definitely more hectic and it's highly skill based.  I'm continuing to find new strategies to get an edge on the other players, and steadily working my way up the leader boards.  Plus, it's cross platform!  I was able to play against my brother, while I was on my computer, and he was playing on his tablet, awesome stuff.  I'd recommend this to anyone looking for a quirky and fun game they can play anywhere.
