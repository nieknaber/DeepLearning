Killzone Mercenary is a defining game for the PS Vita.  It has spectacular graphics, great game play as a shooter should be (with a great immersive story and challenges), and above all else, a current online supported game for multiplayer action.  Team, lone, or objective is online.  I rate this game whether cartridge or digital download, a five star rating because it has great replay value.  And note* to digital downloads, it needs 3GB worth of space so PLEASE plan ahead and invest in either 8GB or 16GB memory stick.
