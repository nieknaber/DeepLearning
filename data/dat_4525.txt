I've tried everything from Googling it, to contacting EA support, and Amazon support.  The best I can get is there is &#34;a known issue&#34; for Mac downloads of Sims, and they're &#34;working on it&#34;.  It's not Amazon's fault, as the same thing happened when we downloaded another Sims from a different site.  It downloads and installs fine, but when you run the game, it doesn't recognize the expansion pack.  Mac users beware.
