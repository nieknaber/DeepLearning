I bought Crysis 2 because I had just left Manhattan, and the game literally looked like a DVD.<br /><br />Crysis 3 has even better graphics, although the futuristic story makes the visuals less believable once you enter the Dome. The beginning is realistic though and the graphics are simply breathtaking. Much like Crysis 2, the multi-player is loads of fun and there are always a few games going, even at 3am on a Tuesday.<br /><br />The largest improvement over Crysis 2 is the campaign. Th campaign is genuinely fun and exciting. The story is good (for a shooter), and the gameplay is truly fun. I could never get into the campaign for Crysis 2, but I have spent hours on Crysis 3. It is a great time. The multi-player is my favorite for FPS.<br /><br />An added bonus is the shear beauty of the graphics. The game will play on any reasonable system (you can play at 720p with solid frame rates on an AMD A10 APU, and it will play at 1080p on a 7750). My EVGA 660ti runs it at high/very high at a decent frame rate (I run Crysis 2 at Ultra). If you want to run this game at ultra at 1080p, you will need a $400+ graphics card. if you want ultra at higher resolutions (1600 or 1440), or you want 1080p at 120 hrz, you will need to SLI 780's or crossfire 290's.<br /><br />This is a graphically beautiful game that is also a lot of fun. in addition, use the tutorial. it is the best I have ever seen. I wish I had this for Crysis 2. Every game should have tutorials of this caliber.
