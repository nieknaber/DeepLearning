This game was a blast to play for me, as a fan of the Comedy Central series - South Park. Crude humor that is very topical but also smart and snarky. Definitely an &#34;M&#34; rated game through and through with bad language, cartoon nudity and disturbing visuals. If you know who Mr. Slave is and what he has done on the show, then you can imagine what I mean.<br /><br />The game play is old school turn based combat where when you run into an enemy it will take you to a battle screen. There are 4 &#34;Classes&#34; in the game that really only affect your special moves as anyone can use any weapon. There are some &#34;Active&#34; battle systems in place where you need to react to cues on screen for attacks to go off or to block for reduced damage. It reminded me a lot of the game &#34;Penny Arcade on the rain-slick precipice of darkness&#34; which I played on the Xbox 360 as a downloadable title. There is a lot of loot and much of it is a callback to the show. Weapons, armor, upgrades, consumables... almost all of them have been mentioned in the show. I explored a lot and did not rush through the game and finished it in about 18 hours, but I was soaking it all in and have walked around after the endgame collecting items and finishing up side quests. I have 26 hours in the game with only 1 character class so far, but anyone could see most of the game and beat it in 12 - 15 hours or so.<br /><br />The graphics are identical to the show, which is exactly what the creators were going for. I had a few minor graphical issues that worked themselves out without restarting the game, but I have heard that some people have bigger issues. Such is life in PC gaming. It doesn't seem to require a Beefy computer to run well but perhaps it does. I run a custom built PC with a 3rd gen i5 3570K, 16GB RAM and an MSI 7870 2GB Video Card and had no real issues. Not the latest hardware by any means, but no slouch either.<br /><br />The story lines up with the end of a 3 part episode of the show that involves the console wars (Xbox One and PS4), Black Friday, Game of Thrones and LARPing. They are probably the best episodes of the latest season of South Park and will certainly be considered for a best of South Park compilation in the future.<br /><br />TL:DR - Great for fans of South Park, Not too difficult, requires a stronger PC than expected. 12 - 15 hours longshow that involves the console wars (Xbox One and PS4), Black Friday, Game of Thrones and LARPing.
