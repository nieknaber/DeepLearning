I love the game, but there's too many issues getting it to start!<br /><br />I bought it yesterday, and I had to download the installation thing so many times before it decided to work. Then after I finally got it to install, I had to reinstall it SO MANY TIMES because it kept telling me to insert the disc.<br /><br />Finally, I got it to work. I got to play it for about 10 seconds, because there was a major fuck-up on the screen. The right side of my screen had a frozen bar going down the screen that made exiting the game difficult because it covered the button that turned off the game.<br /><br />I can't complain too much though, I had a $10 Amazon gift card so it was free.
