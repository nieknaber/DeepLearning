On the game:<br />Battlefield 4 is a huuuuuge disappointment. I have a high end computer that runs everything thrown at it....but Battlefield 4? Talked to Nidia Support and they are swamped with record numbers of calls relating to problems with Battlefield 4. Battlefield 4 crashes and locks up my computer. Can't play more that  a few minutes before crashes.<br />EA support sounded if they were a room full of teenagers....in way over their heads. They had me do all kinds of things that didn't work....they are lost. I was going to upgrade my video card and possible run in SLI until a Nviida tech said it probably would not help. He said my card was fine but there were other problems possible relating to Battlefield 4 conflicting with my OS, Windows 7-64. This game is not ready for prime time as evidenced by the huge numbers of purchasers complaints.<br /><br />On Amazon not refunding:<br />  With this purchase, it seems Amazon is not  taking returns. If Amazon is going to retail this game then they should accept returns......Origin can disable all server access to the purchaser so the purchaser can not longer play. That seems fair to me.<br /> I have spent $60 for a product that I cannot use. I feel I deserve a refund for<br />battlefield 4. Anything else is unacceptable. I buy almost exclusively for Amazon. I buy predominately computer parts, accessories and electronics. Many \\"gamers\\" are computer enthusiast and buy form Amazon because they historically have the best shopping experience around. Not giving refunds on the game could cost them in the long run.
