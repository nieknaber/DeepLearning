Don't even bother wasting your money on this game.  I just got it yesterday and it's already crashed 3 times even after lowering all the hardware settings.  This is on a Windows 7 system with 2 gaming video cards and 8 gigs of ram with striped hard disks and a fiber optic connection.  COD MW3 was a million times better and never crashed once!!!<br /><br />The zombie game seems relatively stable but slow.  I've purchased games for $5 that had better graphics and action.  I think the glowing reviews seen so far are from people that are invested somehow with the developer.
