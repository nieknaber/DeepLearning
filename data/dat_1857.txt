I love the original X-COMs.  It was turn-based goodness that came out of nowhere back in 1994 and deserves all the praise it gets.<br /><br />That being said, I am 20 years older now, and, frankly, playing X-COM now is just WORK.  Manually loading up your team every single missions.  Manually juggling base supplies, ammo down to the last shell, and weapons.  This and that and... it's just exhausting now.<br /><br />The new XCOM basically takes all of the interesting decisions that existed in X-COM '94 and boils them down into a game that more resembles a new-school boardgame rather than the old wargame that X-COM '94 was.  And it does it with surprising panache.  The chrome of the old game is stripped away to leave the same tense, challenging core.  And, oh yes, the new XCOM will punish you appropriately.<br /><br />There's only two weaknesses I can see in the new game, but they're biggies.  First, the strategic game really only has one golden path that MUST follow, or you're doomed (satellites, satellites, satellites!)  And second, the new game is nowhere near as replayable as the old.  Beat this game once at normal settings, and you're down the road of diminishing interest if you choose to tackle it again on a harder or more randomized mode.  Compare this to the endless tinkering you could do in the old game.  Then again, you could spend all of your time tinkering in the old game, and get nowhere, so there is that.<br /><br />Synopsis: only the grumbling old OCD gamers can really complain about the new game.  Everyone else will appreciate the fresh, streamlined look.
