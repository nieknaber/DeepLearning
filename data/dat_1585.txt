It really is nice to take a break from regular play and go on a little trip. The transition from my Sims town to the destination takes forever though. But that's probably more my PC and less the game. Anyway, it's a nice time to take a &#34;restroom/snack&#34; break. I love the adventures I've had so far. Some are a little tricky though and when I get stuck I usually find enough message boards online with the answers I need. One thing I don't like Is it doesn't appear the adventures are random. There is a set order the adventures go in, so when one sim visits France and completes the first adventure, the next sim to go will have the same adventure, except all the doors are already opened, and secrets revealed. There are still treasures to be found, but the hard part is done. It would be nice if the adventures were more random. I haven't run into a mummy yet, but I'm worried about it, so I save before every trip just in case I need to go back and save a favorite character. I also maxed my guy out on Martial Arts skills so he can kick some Mummy tail...All and all it's a pretty good expansion pack and I liked it more than I thought I would. I even brought a few foreigners home to live in my town. I wish I could play the families in the foreign towns though.
