A while ago I decided to get the live through Xbox itself and one month later it auto renewed WAIT I told them not to auto renew and it told them to stop and sure enough next month bam $10 more dollars have been billed the the credit card after twice telling them no auto renewal this time they did it right wow finally thank gosh that was $20 I wasn't thinking of spendin. So a few months later I wanted live again called before the fact and said no auto renewal AAAAA!!!!!!!! It happens again this is driving me crazy tell them no more ever. Well from now on I will stick with the amazon way of. Buying it much easier NEVER dealing with Xbox again so u shouldn't either.
