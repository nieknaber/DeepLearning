I was waiting for the price to drop for the PS3 version, but saw the price for the PC download version and jumped (though it took me 7 hours to download on my 25/25 Verizon Fios connection). I'm glad I did because it's mainly 1st person except when using cover and I've never been able to master 1st person gaming on the PS3.<br /><br />I'm still early into the game, but so far I'm enjoying the experience. This is a slower paced game to take your time with, which I like. I'm the kind of person that likes to do all the missions right (yes, that includes reloading from mission beginning to get items and secondary goals I missed) so I suspect it will take me 25-30 plus hours to complete. There is a lot of NPC interaction with different conversation choices that will affect certain outcomes of missions and what people say about you or recent mission events on the streets. Definitely reminicent of the Cyber-punk games of the 90's.<br /><br />Gameplay seems more geared toward sneaking, considering the 3rd person 'cover' mode allowing you to press against obstacles and walls and peer around corners to see what the enemy is doing. This mode also allows you to round corners or cross open gaps between obstacles with the press of a button. One notable action that seems to be missing here is the ability to vault over objects. It would be nice if, while in 'cover' mode, you could vaut over an object. Instead, you have to get out of 3rd person mode (now you are staring straight at the obtacle you are hiding behind), stand up (if you were ducking) and jump over the obstacle. I'd like to be able to hit a button while in the cover mode so I can see where the enemy is while I'm making my move. Not a deal breaker, but it slows down gameplay a bit more than needed.<br /><br />Another thing I don't like is that displayed mission goal indicators (x)'s on your hud are on regardless if they are \\"active\\" or \\"inactive\\". Green are secondary missions and green are secondary missions.<br /><br />This is not a FPS shooter by any stretch. If you go into battle guns blazing you will run out of bullets and enemies fast and you'd probably get bored even faster.<br /><br />Enjoy.
