The install was very easy, make sure to login to your playonline account and put your access code in. I have not done a lot of the new content but from what I have done so far I was not too impressed. FYI do the quest to unlock the new area its very fast and you'll save 1M gil.<br /><br />***Update***<br /><br />I don't think the content is that great, I have stopped playing as much I just think SE is trying to squeeze every penny out of us.
