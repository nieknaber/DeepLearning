The original two X-Com games (UFO Defense and Terror from the Deep) are two of my favorite games of all time. They are a bit dated now with respect to the graphics, but the story is great, the game play is great, and now they run well on Windows 7. For the price, I also got the newest one, Enemy Unknown. Enemy Unknown is a reasonable reboot of the original, although the gameplay on the base screen is a bit clunky in my opinion. Others like it immensely, but I just haven't gotten used to it yet. I'm used to a 2D/pseudo 3D interface from the old versions, I guess. Other than that, I love this set of games, Enforcer included.
