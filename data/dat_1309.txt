This was for my wife who insisted that this was the best computer bridge game available. It downloaded very well and she is enjoying it often. Now I need to find out how to download it onto a new Laptop computer that we have acquired.  How do I accomplish this either &#34;also&#34; or &#34;instead&#34; of our desktop it is on now. I would recommend this computer bridge very highly as it is just what she was wishing for.
