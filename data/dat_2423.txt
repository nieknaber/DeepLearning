I used to play this with my dad when I was younger and could never find the disk after we moved. I was so excited when I was told I could download it onto my computer! It's everything I remember it to be and now I can play it again. This is also better than the disk version because it doesn't freeze and with computers only getting more advanced, the game works incredibly fast.
