This is an entirely new approach to the hidden object genre.  Part of the game is a feature-length film (82 minutes, according to IMDB) that you watch in five-minute chunks.  A list of props pops up during the film segments, and at the end of the clip, you have to click on the props that did not appear in the clip to earn an extra hint.  After about 30 seconds of the clip, you can skip it if you like, but that reduces the game to an ordinary object hunt.    After each clip, you search one or two locations from the clip for hidden objects.  There are some variations on the list-of-objects style - a few 'find the differences' scenes and one in which you find similar objects hidden in two different scenes.  There are only three mini-games. Content - both the film and the hidden objects - is appropriate for kids and adults.    The film is professional and the acting decent (my favourite is Chris Elliott as a gator - alligator - keeper).  The hidden object scenes are the only negative - the graphics could be better.  There is no option for time-limits and no scoring, so this game is not for competitive players, and there is nothing scary or gruesome for the horror-philes.  I do think the game is a bit over-priced (currently $19.99) considering that it has very little replay value.
