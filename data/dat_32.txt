It's an okay game. That's about it. Bioshock 1 was a clunky and stupidly put together, but immersed you so deeply in the story and the action that when it was over it left a huge impression. Bioshock 1 had all of the immersion, but substituted a compelling story for better gameplay.<br />Infinite, however, should be considered among the ranks of COD or battlefield. A nice, pretty shooter, and that's about it.
