The game is good, but that is completely irrelevant when most of the people can not even play. I understand its release but the issues with the service account, low server count, web page layout, and people's registration code not working anymore. Im stuck not being able to play due to clicking the wrong button when making the account. I now have 2 services on one account. One that has no game and all my preorder bonuses and characters, and the other that has my game registered to it but nothing else. Its so confusing and frustrating. They are handling the situation one case at a time, which is taking forever. There are thousands of people in this same situation trying to get it resolved. Knowing that this is NA amazon, if this happens to you, good luck getting in to speaking to a representative. Eu And JP have had slow resolutions, but nothing close to how slow NA is handling it. If you get it and are playing, good for you. However, as of right now... skip it. wait a month and see if they are being more productive.<br /><br />Edit: everything was fixed after about a week ofter all the problems. The game is fun and its something I really enjoy playing. If you like MMOs please, come try it. Its a blast
