First off, I bought this game at $4.49 during an Amazon Feb sale.  It is hard for me to say any game is not worth that price.  I can say the game is not worth the $39.99 it is currently priced at.<br /><br />In summary, the game is a Gears of War clone.  Two main characters act and look sort of like Marcus and Dom, there is the loud veteran commander at one point, there are the drill machines where enemies pour out of the ground, and there is the rifle that looks exactly like an old Lancer.  There was definitely some \\"cutting and pasting\\" going on.  Inversion does add some quirks of its own with gravity related physics, some environmental destructibility, and a cool twist in the story.  It reminds me of the equivalent of a good bad B-movie.  One thing i appreciate, even if it is a clone, at least it controls well.<br /><br />Technically speaking the game won't break your PC with requirements and the end product reflects that.  It looks better than the console versions and there are some really good environments and details at times, however the character models are bland and aren't really animated all that well.  Highs and lows.<br /><br />The 3rd person cover shooter never really made it to PC.  Just one Gears game.  For PC enthusiasts this will be a nice treat, for the rest of us that have played Gears it is an average title that if you can buy under $10, I recommend.  Otherwise, skip it, you won't miss any sleep wondering what you're missing.
