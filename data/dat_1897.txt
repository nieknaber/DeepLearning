I had no problems with the download or anything like that. I'm a little disappointed with the game, however. When I got the Pets expansion it kept me entertained for several months and there was a lot of extra gameplay added, however I've had Seasons for about a week and I've gone through all the seasons and it's just not very interesting. Luckily I got it on sale, but a different expansion set may be more \\"bang for your buck\\". So I say wait until this is on sale or get a different expansion set if you want something that will keep boredom away.<br />However, I will add that if you're looking for a small expansion or something where it just makes the game more fun, this is just fine.
