A fan of hidden object games, this one is not very good.  The is a lot of written dialogue, but little graphic action.  The scenes themselves are of poor quality making the location of objects difficult.  And one puzzle was random to say the least with no \\"notebook\\" or help button to explain the meaning of the challenge.  I wouldn't buy this game.
