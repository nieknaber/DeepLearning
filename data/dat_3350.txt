All in all, I thoroughly enjoy this game and it was well worth what I paid for it. Does it have a few bugs? Yes. Does it feel like the studio could have spent a little more time polishing it? Yes. Will we be remembering this game in twenty years? Probably not. That being said, I think if more than a few people took some tips from this game the rest of the RPG world wouldn't be so cliche and predictable. I would say that the Mount and Blade series as a whole is most likely a series destined to only ever have a cult following. It's not as flashy as time-tested, market crushing titles that have spent years in development with budgets of millions of dollars, but it does have the meat and bones of a great game. I applaud the designers and developers and hope to see more of their work in the future, if not in this title at least in another. In closing I would say, if you're an avid RPGer and are looking for something different and who doesn't mind overlooking some superficial flaws, I would highly recommend this game.
