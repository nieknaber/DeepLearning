This is the absolutely worst of the M&M releases. The game is incomplete; buggy; not optimized and gets no support whatsoever from its disaster of developers and technical support.<br /><br />I am not talking about the pre-release but the full release with the activation code. First you need both Steam and Uplay to run it. Fine I get two accounts which I do not want. Next it needs to spend a couple of hours downloading and updating and of course the activation process. Having done all of this the thing is unable to get past the first region. It stubbornly &#34;greys&#34; out the dialogue for moving beyond the Agyn Peninsula. There are instructions online as how to edit the XML files to get past this but &#34;are you kidding?&#34; I am supposed to edit XML to get past an obvious bug. Don't get me going on the load times which are known by everyone to be outrageously long. The company should shut down if that is their quality of work. Even then they have done immense damage to reputation of any self respecting software producer.<br /><br />I will never buy anything made by this disaster of a company.
