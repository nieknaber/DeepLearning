Realm Reborn was cute but overall pretty boring. The classes are literally straight forward with zero customization, the quests hold your hands and there was no feeling of tension..simply going through motions. Not a bad game but not what I would call a good one. Pretty, though.<br /><br />Having spent the past couple of weeks playing Elder Scrolls Online instead, I can absolutely recommend that over Realm Reborn.
