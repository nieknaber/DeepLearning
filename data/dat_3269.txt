It took about 4 or 5 hours to get a code, just like the other reviewers mentioned.<br /><br />The code, still - 16 hours later, continues to give me &#34;0 credits&#34; when I try to purchase apps from the MS phone store.<br /><br />I'm still waiting for Amazon support. I needed the app yesterday. Now there's no point, but still would like my credit to function.
