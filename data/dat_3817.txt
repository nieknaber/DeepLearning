Agatha Christie: Death on the Nile is easily the most challenging Seek and Find game I've played.  After the first four or five levels, I was unable to complete any additional level on the first try, which is a good thing in my book.  It's such a well-designed game, with such brilliantly hidden objects, that the game doesn't become frustrating even after several attempts at a given level.  You can't just depend on remembering everything from earlier attempts because each replay involves a nice assortment of different hidden objects.  You do get five hints per level, and - unless you're more skilled at this type of game than I am - you're probably going to need them.  With just twenty-five minutes per level to find sixty or more objects across as many as six rooms, you can't just dally around.  You also have to figure out different kinds of puzzles at the end of each level, a couple of which are far from obvious at first glance.<br /><br />I can't say that I really tried to follow along with all of Poirot's reasoning and attempt to solve the mystery myself, though.  Since this game is so challenging, I ended up playing it over several days' time.  That being the case, and given the fact that we're talking about a fairly involved mystery encompassing a number of characters, the game is not all that conducive to amateur sleuthing.  I think you're going to want to stick with Agatha Christie's novels to really appreciate the brilliance of the author's story-telling prowess and to truly match wits with Hercule Poirot.  Just enjoy this game for what it is, a truly impressive and challenging Seek and Find adventure.
