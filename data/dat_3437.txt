I've wanted this expansion pack for a while and I finally bought it when the price dropped really low. I like the things it adds, but not as much as I would. Still, it adds a lot of cool things to the game and I don't regret my purchase. If I had payed more than fifteen bucks for it, then yes, I would regret it, but for such a low price, I have no real qualms.
