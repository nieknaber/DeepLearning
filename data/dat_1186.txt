First off I have a Dell xps 410 with windows VISTA pro and the game ran smoothly with no issues.  GAMEPLAY:  I found the game to be entertaining, and worth the purchase.  It is sort of a cross between Grand theft auto, Dungeons and dragons, and Thief.  You basically run around stealing, picking locks, and of course killing, with lots of quests thrown in.  It is definatly a take charge type of game, you have to activly seek out quests before you leave an area, the side quests don't jump out at you.  You definatly have to find them yourself.  I have found that the game responds diferently based on how you change your basic stats at the start, so it would seem to be very replayable.  HINTS (Not story related):  Shift + right click on other members of your party can add them togehter to give group marching or attack orders.  Control + right click on a npc will allow you to attack them.  Control + right click on party members photos will allow cross trading among your team.  If the bodies stack up around or over an item you want to pick up, just drop several items close by where it was dropped to have it form a bag that you can loot out of like a chest.  If possible pickpocket everyone before talking with them, it's extra exp.
