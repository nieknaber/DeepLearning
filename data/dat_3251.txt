Double Fine's Brutal Legend was the kick in the pants I needed when it came to Metal and Rock N' Roll. Introducing me to some hidden gems and allowing me to rock out as I marched across the battlefield.<br /><br />Brutal Legend transports you from cover to cover of classic metal/rock albums. Imagine Judas Priest's '[[ASIN:B008BO61BE Screaming For Vengeance - Special 30th Anniversary Edition (CD/DVD)]]' album art coming to life or an entire area of gameplay inspired by Iron Maiden's '[[ASIN:B000063DFN Powerslave]]' album. I could go on and on about the feel and aesthetic that Brutal Legend brings to the table for gamers.<br /><br />Gameplay: The first section of the game teaches you how to summon items,attacks, and other elements within the world to help you slice n' dice your foes. This is done through more or less a third-person hack and slash action game approach. The biggest issue that gamers had with Brutal legend is the fact that it turns into a third-person RTS (Real Time Strategy) game near the second act (Which I personally love) most players couldn't make the leap and thus the game did somewhat poorly on the consoles.<br /><br />Multi-player: Same as before, pitting two players against each other in a stage battle. The stage acts as a HQ where you can spawn units and even play your rock anthem (a song from the soundtrack) to fight along with. It's cool when one player is listening to 'Black Sabbath' while the other is listening to 'Scorpions'. You'll both fight over resources or (Fans) to offer as tribute. Tribute summons units, rinse/repeat and lead your army into battle. With the ability to mount/join your units to add extra damage or effect to the enemies stage(HQ). It's typical RTS format with a refreshing theme and play style.<br /><br />This format will also happen in the single player as you fight against certain groups or factions, with some boss fights peppered in for variety. So if you've read this far and it doesn't interest you...Brutal Legend might not work for you.<br /><br />Port: I've played through the first hour of story and I was part of the multi-player beta offered during the pre-order period. It's a decent port, controls seem natural with your num keys acting as your guitar solo (summon) keys. Even if you don't feel the lighting with a keyboard, it has full controller support through Steam. So plug up a 360 controller and rock on.<br /><br />Gripes n' Poops : A lack luster options menu. Some minor clipping issues so far (ex. While I was in the Motor Forge buying upgrades, camera basically fell through the floor on certain selections)<br /><br />...if anything crazy happens I'll be sure to update my review. Double Fine has been rolling out constant update since the first day the game was made available for pre-order on steam.<br /><br />Don't worry about future support, Tim Schafer (Creative Director) said,<br /><br />\\"I mean, we have a wishlist from when we made this version. But since we are a small developer publishing it ourselves, we have to go with the best version we can make and then hope it's successful so we can add more. I would love to do alternate gameplay modes in multiplayer. I'd like to bring in Lionwhyte as a playable faction. There are some tweaks I'd like to do to give you more feedback about what your units are doing\\" - An exert from Destructoid. [...]<br /><br />Overall: If you passed this up in 09' it's very much worth your time this time around. With fantastic voice acting, over 100 licensed tracks of metal/rock, and a part that Jack Black was born to play. But beware if you don't really care for metal music or RTS it won't be the game for you. These elements are deep within the roots of the game. With the game being built on music and the game feel being brought out though leading your army to \\"Tag Team\\" by Anvil as a (battle of the bands) if you will.<br /><br />So take my bias filled review and give it a shot...if nothing else the next time Amazon or Steam have a sale give this title some love.
