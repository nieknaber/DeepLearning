The game starts out with well done graphics and a very compelling story line. Unfortunately I didn't get much farther than that. Movement was not intuitive, at least for me, but I was able to figure out that the right mouse button moves you forward quickly enough. What did me in was the super-sensitive mouse activity. I went into the settings and was thrilled to discover you could actually change the settings for mouse sensitivity.. until I clicked in it and nothing happened. I saved the game. Perhaps if I can work out how to change the mouse issue I can play again. For now, after about five minutes of game play, I'm going to need some Excedrin.
