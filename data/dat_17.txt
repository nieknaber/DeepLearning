I continue to be surprised by how good the lego games are.  This, LoTR, Batman 2, and the new Marvel one are all amazing.  Get this if you like Harry Potter and you like legos.  Get this if you just like cute but fun games that are well made and have good coop play.  It is best played with an xbox 360 controller or a similar gamepad.
