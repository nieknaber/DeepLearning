I enjoyed playing this game until it started crashing my computer.  I had to buy a new hard drive and re-loaded the game NOT REALIZING that it was the game that had a virus and the same thing happened again.  I removed the game and contacted Amazon and let them know of the problem.  They issued me accredit, they are good about complaints, but it was an expensive learning experience!  Do not download this game!
