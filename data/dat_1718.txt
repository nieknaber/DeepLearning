Steam is an online gaming community.  You will have to install the client.  It will keep your games in the cloud.  After my purchase for my son I realized that I should have read all the way down the description to the last sentence that says Steam is required.  Then I should have done reasearch into what Steam was.<br /><br />What a waste of 19 bucks!  After spending an hour getting it installed my son asked me everytime he started the game - &#34;What does this mean I need to log in?&#34;, &#34;Why does it take so long?&#34;, &#34;What is the cloud&#34;, &#34;Dad the internet is down and I can't get my saved games&#34;, &#34;Dad it's asking me if I should sync with the Cloud, what do I do?&#34;, &#34;Dad my game is lost!&#34;<br /><br />On top of that the Steam client stayed running on the computer even after the game was closed - unless I killed it.  I ended up removing Steam and the game and forked over an additional 19 bucks for the download version of game.  I can't stress how much Steam sucks, so much so I ate the cost of my original purchase.  Anything that just causes headaches, so much so that it is removed warrants 0 stars.  My son has been having a blast with the download version.  Save your time and money and stay away from the Steam Online Game code version.
