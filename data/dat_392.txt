I haven't had alot of time to explore the features of this expansion, but I like what I've seen so far. I liked the new occupations and activities associated with this expansion.  Guiding your Sims in the new occupations (e.g., getting gigs) is appealing, rather than the passive sending the Sim to a work location.
