Yes, it's a little slow going, but this is the spice road.  You're walking from one end of Asia to the other.      I love love love the Tradewinds games.  I've played all of the characters in all of the games at least twice.  They come with something so common in modern media but so lacking in modern video games.  The funny.  Yes, the funny!  If I download one more game that's sincerely about a sincere mystery about a sincerely wholesome family or rearrange another freaking sincere jewel or escape from another flimsy plot about someone leaving sincere but arbitrary hints in a locked room in the name of \\"fun\\" I'm going to lose all faith in the gaming market.  I mean, what have we got?  One game that promises cake, but never brings it (good), The Sims (gooder) and the lovely Tradewinds series (yay!).  I need to take the person who wrote the dialogue for this game out for cocktails.  But I need her (I'm guessing it's a her) to make more games like now.      If you're thinking of buying sincere Chocolatier, skip it and get Tradewinds.
