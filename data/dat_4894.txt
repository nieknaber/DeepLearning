The two-stars is not for the game itself, but for the Viva release of the game. I have had trouble with their downloads before and they do not offer any support. With this download, the last one-third will take twice as long as the first two- thirds. The closer the game gets to completion, the slower the download. You can anticipate to two hour download for a file that should take only one-half hour.
