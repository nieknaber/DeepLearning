I play a lot of hidden object games like this one.  This is definitely one of the best I have played.  The objects are not easy to find especially the keys but it is fun.  It is not timed so you can take your time to find everything.  Nice graphics.  This is the first time I finished a game and started playing it again right away.  That says a lot as I don't like to repeat these games.  I recommend it.
