I downloaded this because I had a knee injury and couldn't walk for a few weeks so I  thought this would keep me entertained. Like the other reviewers said before this is, in fact, a very easy game. I beat it in about 2 hours. Granted there are a few levels I had to try a few times to complete. The game pretty much has the same character, a few new ones, like lawyers. And the catch is you can't place groups of lawyers next to each other because they'll argue and upset the other tables. There is also earthquakes, rain, and electrical stuff that breaks. So you have to secure tables, put up umbrellas, or fix the electric problem within a certain amount of time of the customers leave. There are also other things that break so you have to have Flo's buddy fix them. Anyway it'll keep you entertained for a short time. But it wont take you as long as the other Diner Dash games.
