Many claim that Far Cry 3 attempts to deconstruct the typical action game story and, in a way, parody it. I guess I can see that, but, in the end, I don't really care. It's a game after all, so to offer some critique of the genre in a game I'm probably playing because I want to escape with that genre is a little weird. I don't think it's even that successful at portraying the supposed intent.<br /><br />In the end, you really don't care about the main characters or anyone else around you. The story gets weird and things just get more and more insane. In the end, you're just playing to play the game.<br /><br />And this is where Far Cry 3 falls short for me. At first it seems amazing. There's stealth elements, hunting and gathering, all with a free roam world and typical FPS gameplay. None of these lived up to their promise, though. The stealth is annoying. Enemies somehow know exactly where you are despite sniping some guy from many meters away. The AI is incredibly exploitable and stupid. Hunting and gathering comes and goes far too fast. It's not fleshed out in the slightest and you can do a majority of the important stuff in the first half of the game. Most of the consumables you can craft aren't even worth making.<br /><br />On the normal difficulty, the game was far too easy. Far Cry 3 felt like a lot of promising ideas that were not completely executed. That, along with a story that actively makes you dislike the vanilla protagonist, makes for a mostly forgettable experience.
