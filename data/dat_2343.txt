I'll start with the download.  I'm using a Windows 7 Laptop.  This took about 5 hours to download with no problems.  Extracted and installed perfectly.  Game started immediately, and worked perfectly.  I use a variety of laptops from XP thru win 7, and from minis to full size and have not encountered any problems with Amazons down loader.<br /><br />As for the game itself, I would never have purchased the CD game, in fact I've scowled at it in stores. ;).  I am a die-hard Sims2 fan and there could be no room for improvement. I have read countless reviews of Sims3 since it release and most have not been good.  Just reaffirmed my steering clear of it as far as I was concerned.  But...<br /><br />After reading the Amazon reviews again last night, I figured since I could simply download it, if I didn't like it at least it wouldn't be collecting dust in a corner of the house somewhere. :D<br />So, after the install I let it load the game, I read through all the tutorials, and started the game play.  The directions were clear - well, most of them, I still have a lot to figure out - the basics are easy enough to figure out if you've played the Sims before.  I really expected to just be disappointed and quit the game and get on with my life, but, noooo.  This had to be an intriguing new form of game play.  There really is much more control than one may have been led to believe.<br /><br />I have very little game time in yet, only about 3 hours, but I have really enjoyed this game much more than I ever expected to already.  I'll give it more time and expand on this review but I think the expansion packs are in my future.<br /><br />I'll cherish the Sims2 always, but I am glad I finally gave the 3rd generation a chance.  Thanks Amazon for offering this Game as a download.  I would have missed out on some real fun, again. :)<br /><br />-----UPDATE-----<br /><br />Ok, the game worked perfect for a few hours, and then it froze up and I lost all my progress etc.  GRRRRR.<br /><br/>This happened to me twice so I started hunting around for answers.  When you bring up the menu to play the game, there is an offer to \\"UPDATE through the EA download manager\\" included on the menu panel.  I hadn't done that.<br /><br />The game version you download from here is 1.07 something, and by the time you've allowed all the updating, you end up with Version 1.37 something.  HUGE update.<br /><br />It took a couple of hours to update and mess with getting things done, but it was very worth it in the end.  The game has played without a hitch since then, with about 24 hours game play so far.<br /><br />I'm not going to go into all the differences on Sims3 versus 2, some great, some really sad, but I still don't regret this purchase a bit.<br /><br />-----UPDATE-----<br /><br />Last update I'll make for Sims 3.  Complete and total addiction.<br /><br />I love being able to create different families in-game, but spend all my time on ONE family as the others age respectively.  I make friends with my Sim creations, but the focus can be on my favorite Sim. It makes game play much less stressful switching homes to keep everyone aging equally.<br /><br />I'm still reading reviews of people finding it boring with nothing to do (?) and it boggles my mind.  There's so much to do there isn't enough time in a Sim day, as usual. :)<br /><br />I've had no trouble with crashing, graphics, or anything, since I updated the game from EA download manager.<br /><br />I'm so glad I gave this game a chance.  I plan on buying the DVD version also, just to have it.<br /><br />***I'm just going to add one more suggestion for anyone who may have problems with gameplay.  I have Never been able to play the Sims, of any version, without in-game problems, when my computer is ON-line.  I Always disconnect my internet connection before playing it.  I don't know why it is, but it just is.  Even to this day I have glitch problems if I forget to disconnect.  ***And remember to do a defrag after the download and the Up-date.  It makes a huge mess of your comp files, and a defrag will give a smoother gameplay for you. :) Have fun!
