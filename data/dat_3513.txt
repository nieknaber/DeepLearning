ETW has been a pleasure to play.<br /><br />Economics/Development - Economics and trade are both somehow more complex and yet easier to understand.  Much better than previous editions in the TW family.  You are not only able to know where your goods are going and how they are getting there, but you have much more ability to develop trade resources and economic infrastructure.  The system of raiding trade routes is satisfying, and you can see the financial impact of blocking trade to an enemy.  Unlike previous TW games, settlement growth is not confined to the one city per province model.  Rather you have a regional capital where you recruit troops and build/expand buildings, and scattered about your province you have villages that crop up and eventually develop into towns or ports and you can determine what type of town you want, based on needs and goals.  This for more interesting play AND adds an added element to warfare, where the goal might not necessarily be outright conquest of a territory (or you might not be strong enough to take the capitol), but you can disrupt research, destroy farms, damage the economy and create religious and social unrest by attacking other settlements in a region.  It's no longer enough to just defend the city but the entire region as well.<br /><br />Land Warfare - Is familiar enough and intuitive with earlier TW games.<br /><br />Naval Warfare - Is difficult, especially when you control multiple ships.  Luck plays a much greater role than in land warfare, in that wind and wave can impact your shots, and sometimes you lose a mast, or catch on fire, or just freaking explode.  But it's an interesting challenge!<br /><br />Agents - Gentlemen and Rakes are an interesting change and, I think, totally appropriate to the setting.  There are discussions on the TW forum about the utility of the agent characters for different purposes, but I like the way they are employed.
