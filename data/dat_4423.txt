Do not download this game from this site. Download time is terrible, it took me 32 hours for the 10.2g from amazon, it only took me 8 hours to get Shogun 2 from steam (13G). Then as the file finishes Amazons own security will come up and tell you the file is corrupted and prompt to to restart the entire download over. Save your time and money and get the game somwhere else.
