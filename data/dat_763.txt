This game has fun, intuitive game play, with characters that are well-built and a storyline that is deliciously silly at times.  The variety of powers is incredible, and the snarky take on various tropes is hilarious.  While many of the boss battles have a 'required' mechanic of some kind, the game also frequently provides multiple options for handling various challenges.  You might go invisible to dodge an attack, use levitation to bounce away, use a shield to block it, or simply dodge the attack 'by hand'.<br /><br />In short, it's a brilliant, wonderful game that deserves five stars in it's own right.  Unfortunately, the controls were clearly designed primarily for consoles.  The result is a sometimes frustrating response to expected PC-based controls.  Additionally, the game mechanics sometimes struggle a bit, most notably at the very end of the game, where either the difficulty takes a massive leap, or they simply didn't have the time to fine-tune the game as well as they did everything leading up to it.<br /><br />I may have docked one star for the control related issues, but I still highly recommend this game.  Buy it, enjoy it, and have a really good time.
