I wish I had had this program 65 years ago (sic). For less than $20 (download), you get     1) to play many opponents at different levels of skill. These avatars are given ratings (lowest up to c. 2900), names and images and their tendencies are mentioned. Don't know how well the numbers correspond with actual rankings as far as level of skill goes. You can even play avatars like Alekhine, Tal, etc.    2) an analysis of your game afterwards. A deep voice intoned one one of my games: \\"Black is asleep at the switch. He doesn't see mate in 8.\\" The analysis (continuation moves) is sometimes off; the program is not C3P0.     3) Josh W's Academy with many lessons I should have learned all those years ago, but didn't. Starts with the basics and includes an End Game course - somehow that end game course was never in any of the chess books I had or was given.    4) Many \\"famous games\\"    5) Another academy/course or two    6) Umpteen chess sets to choose from, 2D/3d views    7) charts of how you're doing with each color, what openings were played, etc.    8) A fun mode with lively graphics which I hope will finally interest my granddaughters in chess!    The program doesn't crash during a game. However, in trying to save a game occasionally it freezes up.     I hear there are \\"better\\" programs - maybe, if you want to go straight to train with a goal of tournament play. Otherwise, this is more than fine. I started with a rating of 1100, now up to 1584. And I'm still trying to beat \\"Josh\\" at 8 years old (1600 rating)!
