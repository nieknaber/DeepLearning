\\"Super Mario Bros. 3\\" was a sensation when it came out in the 1980s, and it's just as fun playing it now.  You don't need 3D action, fifty million directions to travel in at the same time, or even high definition to enjoy one of the greatest video games ever produced.  The game play is excellent, the levels are challenging, rewarding, and, yes, oh, so satisfying - just as they were more than twenty years ago.  This is a great game for a short distraction during the day or for hours or serious game playing.
