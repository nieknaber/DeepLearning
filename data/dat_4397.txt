I really like the game. The action is solid, multiplayer is being ironed out every day it seems.  The graphics on PC are outstanding, the way things blow up are pretty amazing.  Overall I really do enjoy the game, and that is all that matters to me.   Are there some bad things, yes, but I can overlook those as long as the game brings me enjoyment.
