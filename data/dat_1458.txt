This is a let down. These companies need to realize that we the consumer pay for a game, for any console, to own it! Not to be dictated and forced to have a constant internet connection which some can not afford to play games with DRM!  You'd sell a lot more games people! O well, another company that lost my business until they stop with DRM!
