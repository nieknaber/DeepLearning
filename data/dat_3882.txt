It needs a console controller, which would be fine if that was clear before purchase, but it wasn't.  Lots of games are ported from a console, so most of us are used to the keyboard/mouse workarounds, but I couldn't get a menu open, couldn't get to any options, even after hitting every key on the keyboard, and couldn't get out of the game because the escape key did nothing.  What a mess.  It's a shame.  The game looked fun.
