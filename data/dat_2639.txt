The Tropico 3 download plays well, with no glitches;it's hours of stress-free urban planning to pleasantly tolerable Latin grooves. Only slightly more involved than #1, Tropico 3 makes it easy to take the reigns of a Caribbean island and focus on what you like most: Like rebels and political intrigue? Or would you rather have an unlimited budget to make a lovely island where everyone earns the same amount of money? I enjoy it (38, M) and so does my daughter (8, F).
