I was greatly disappointed to learn that I couldn't use the download of the Sims 3 without using Origin.  It was not user friendly at all, and since I made a typo in my e-mail address, they could not verify, not could I go back to edit.  Tried to correct the mess at least 3 times.  No success.  So I wasted my money and never used the download.
