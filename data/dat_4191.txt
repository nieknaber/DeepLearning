This is actually a fairly decent game, and I really like the concept. It mixes the traditional match three gameplay with some minor RPG elements. If you have ever played Puzzle Quest this is like an extremely light version of that game. There is no question that Puzzle Quest was used as inspiration for this.<br /><br />You fight a series of monsters in a linear fashion earning gold and experience along the way. With the gold, you can buy equipment to outfit your hero (who is female only). A nice touch is your avatar is updated to reflect the gear you equip, so she does not have a static look throughout the game.<br /><br />The game does get a little repetitive though. The only gold you get is whatever you match yourself, or the enemy does (you got all the their gold once you defeat them). However, there is no multiplier. So you get the same gold per match at the start of the game as you do at the end of the game. This makes the more expensive gear towards the end of the game far more time consuming to acquire, and not in a fun way. Grinding is grinding and there are zero quests to break up that monotony.<br /><br />Overall, it's a decent casual game you can play for a few minutes here and there. The later monsters do take longer to kill though and you can't quit out and save mid-match.
