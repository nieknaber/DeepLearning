This is an excellent game for all HO gamers.  It is not dark and dreary, and is very much fun to play.  It is easy to get more hints, and they have other ways to help find the objects.  You get many scenes to play, and alot of fun for your money!  After trying some of the others, I sure wish there were more like this one!  There are mini games, but none of them are difficult or hard to play.  Many pretty colors through out the game, and lots of objects to find, and this game is NOT timed, which makes it even more fun!  You will be glad you picked this one to try, or to buy!  I am looking for more like it!
