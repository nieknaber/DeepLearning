Unlike most shooters, this one has a basic storyline that you follow.. A plus, in my book. They have nixed one of the biggest gripes of FPS and SPS games by making it impossible to be hit by friendly fire... don't you HATE those guys?.. they come buzzing in and spray EVERYTHING.. including players who are TRYING to play. While this is a work in progress, they seem to have ironed out the major portion of the main bugs and MOST of the smaller ones... it's more like tweaking, now. The interface is pretty standard, so, no unpleasant surprises. Me, I am a sniper at heart, and the game does allow for a limited amount of sniping.. nothing REALLY long range yet. Hope they change that... there are plenty of perches just BEGGING for some soul-satisfying long range, in there. Be warned, though, Hellbugs are a serious problem for the solo player... they WILL swarm you but, with a little practice, you will learn to reload on the run.<br />I only gave it four stars because it DOES need longer range, when you use a marksman's scope... at very long range, the foes simply, are not there, any more. Also, they don't have a sniper's favourite position.. prone, though, they DO have the equivalent of kneeling. All in all, I HAVE recommended it to friends, and recommend it to any serious FPS/SPS/TPS player.
