I play this game every single night and bought this copy for my Husband. He loves it now too. This is not a super action packed game, It is a slow paced, methodical, turn based game in which you make decisions for not only each individual city, but your entire country. You are ruler, and every decision made, from building purchases, to war or peace is dependant upon you, and ultimately the choices that you make. You can play single player, or online with friends,  computer, or strangers (my 21 year old son, my Husband and I play together sometimes). No game is ever the same as the last, and you can buy expansion packs to change the play up a little. If you like conquest, or simulation games, you would more than likely enjoy this game.
