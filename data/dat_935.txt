Another great game from Viva Media. I enjoyed the game and would have given it five stars except for the fact that every once in a while the game will indicate what you to do to complete a task by showing sparkles near the items you need to use. That took some of the fun out of the searching. The extra chapter and hidden object scenes is an excellent addition. Thanks Viva Media.
