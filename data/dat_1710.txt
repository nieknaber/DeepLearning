As one of the approximate 77,000 backers for Pillars of Eternity, first and foremost, I want to send my heartfelt gratitude to the other 76,999 or so backers who share my wish, as well as to reciprocate the thank-you to Obsidian, who kept and delivered on their promise.<br /><br />I am about 20 hours into PoE (Pillars of Eternity) with 2 concurrent games since that's how I roll with PCRPG (AKA CRPG or cRPG).  I play as a fighter (as reliable as ever- and as boring as always)  in one game and as a cipher (new class that reminds me of the warlock in Neverwinter Nights 2 - and happens to be very fitting to PoE's story) in another.  As is, although I am a veteran PCRPG player, I don't feel qualify to give an in-depth review of PoE just yet, and I will update this first impression accordingly.  However, I do have have some insight of PoE in specifics and the PCRPG genre in general that I would like to share...<br /><br />- What PoE is:  First of all, please be certain that PoE is a PCRPG deeply rooted in the old-school table top paper and pen board-games translated into complex video games with top down isometric view that relies heavily on real time but pause-able tactical combat as pioneered by Baldur's Gate 1 and the subsequent classic PCRPGs, with the most notable ones powered by the Infinity Engine such as the Icewind Dale series and Planescape: Torment.  In addition, there are also Neverwinter Nights 2 and its 3 expansions; Drakensang: The Dark Eye and its expansion; Dragon Age: Origins and its expansion; and Arcanum (which is unique as it can be played as either a realtime or turnbase PCRPG).<br /><br />- What PoE is not:  PoE is *NOT* an ARPG (Action RPG)  with flashy and cinematic combat with fast movements that require quick reflex and hand-eye coordination along the lines of  the Diablo series, The Elder Scroll series, or The Witcher 2 (The Witcher 1 - along with some very few others -  is a hybrid of the 2 distinctive genres of PCRPG and ARPG).<br /><br />- Certified 'Build  By PC Gamers for PC Gamers': And funded by PC Gamers to boost, with the 'PC' part emphasized and dignified.  Indeed, PoE is a bonafide tactical PCRPG built by some of the original Black Isle PCRPG dev, not some pseudo action MMORPG pushed through the cookie cutter assembly line by posers and sellouts.<br /><br />- Gameplay and Infrastructure: Very similar to the Infinity engined games of the aforementioned classic PCRPGs of the golden age of PC gaming.  Even though there are some substitution in the glossary, such as &#34;God-like&#34; for &#34;Plane-touched&#34; class, or &#34;Might&#34; instead of &#34;Strength&#34; for attribute, those who have played the classics PCRPG will feel downright warm and cozy at home with PoE.  The major differences I see is that instead of health alone, PoE relies on heath and endurance to determine whether a character is able or incapacitated in combat; and after the tutorial, it will be clear on how this work.  In addition, resting can no longer be spammed freely outside of an inn; that is, resting is now only available with camping gear, which can be purchased for a modest sum.<br /><br />- Difficulty: For easy reference, and for me so far, PoE is definitely easier than Baldur's Gate 1, and slightly easier than Baldur's Gate 2.  However, it is no cake walk. Thus, casual gamers and newbies beware.  As mentioned earlier, experienced PCRPG fans will have liitle or no problem with medium difficulty, and can turn on the expert mode (basically no tutorial pop-up) if they want to.  And for the solid-core PCRPG masochist, there is a one and only one game save perma-death ultra difficulty level to fulfill your twisted heart's desire.<br /><br />- Graphics and Sound: Graphics is nothing to write home about.  It is mediocre at best.  However, it is detailed and well-designed.  The same goes for sounds -- ambient sounds is fairly well done; music is very fitting, but not thrilling.  And as another reviewer stated, voice actingis hit-or-miss ... and sparse.  Simply put, if pure eye and ear candies are the sole factors in how you judge a game, then it's best to move on elsewhere.  And as for the awesome cinematic cutscenes...  Just kidding... What cutscene?  This is an indie Kickstarter game funded by fans' wages, salaries, and allowance.  Do you expect me to describe the QTE (Quick Timed Events) button mashing boss fights as well ? If yes, then so sorry... You are reading the wrong review :-D<br /><br />- Story and Writing:  Still early for me to give a final verdict, but very good so far as expected from Obsidian, and I certainly like it.  However, as a veteran and a semi-jaded PCRPG gamer, it neither hook me in like Baldur's Gate 2 nor dazzle me like Planescape: Torment.  It is more along the line the rest of the other classics PCRPGs - which is still head and shoulder above those of the corporate-regurgitated games nowadays.<br /><br />- (Addendum 3/31/15) Stability: I put in more hours into the game and want to report that stability is quite good so far with no crash or slow down.  Also, just for kick, I installed it on one of my PCs with WinXP, and... it works fine even though XP is not officially supported. However,  I did have one crash after about 5 hours.<br /><br />- Other current PCRPGs that fans of the genre should consider:  I am ecstatic that we are witnessing another Renaissance of PCRPG - a genre that I once thought to be dead and buried after Dragon Age: Origins and Drakensang: the River of Time in 2009, which are the very last 2 genuine PCRPGs released by a major publisher.  But here we are, where die-hard fans and independent developers keep the dream alive.  In addition to PoE, behold Divinity: Original Sin, Wasteland 2, Shadowrun Returns, Shadowrun: Dragon Fall, and Aarklash Legacy.  As a side note, beside Aarklash Legacy,  which is also a realtime PCRPG, in terms of gameplay and combat, I hesitate to compare the others to PoE sin they are turn-based PCRPG.  The subtle difference - but also very major in my book - is that with turnbased PCRPG, only one character can move at a time and you have very little control over which character to move first in combat.<br /><br />- Last but certainly not Least -- To DRM or not to DRM ???  Very simple -- Steam or GOG.  Buy it here or on Steam, you get Steam DRM.  Buy it from GOG, it's DRM-Free.  Your choice !!!  Bravo to Obsidian for giving Customers the choice -- It's a beautiful thing.<br /><br />I will update my impression accordingly; but in closing for now, as one who thinks that Baldur's Gate 2 is the best game ever made with Planescape: Torment being an extremely close second (oversimplification: BG2 has better combat.  PS:T has better story), although PoE is not quite the Baldur's Gate 3 that I dream of , it is a genuine Baldur's gate 2 successor and a dream come true for PCRPG fans in its own rights.  More than that, it is a success story of a successful corroboration between developer and fans - whose common love for PCRPG done right without corporate meddling cannot be denied.  Game On.<br /><br />------<br /><br />Update 4/10/15:  Removed one star due to some sidequest bugs.  Nothing show-stopping, but definitely annoying to see something so sweet getting a bitter dose of unintended flashback; that is, true to form, Obsidian does everything 'right' to have Pillars of Eternity resembles the classics - right down to the bugs.  I have the latest patch 1.03 installed and will replay the quests.  Will reinstate star if bugs are squashed.<br /><br />Update 5/20/15: the game itself is still good and getting even better.  Bugs that I encountered are fixed; however, I am still withholding a star since once again, true to form, patches fixed specific issues but also introduced new ones -- Game saves and load are now much longer on my Win 7 PC (up to approximately 1.5 minute), while Win XP and Vista PCs (yes, I also installed the game Vista to test compatibility and performance) fared better.<br /><br />Update 7/12/15: Save/load speed is back to normal.  Star restored.  Took a break from PoE to complete The Witcher 3, which is an excellent open world ARPG and a milestone achievement in its own rights.  Will go back to complete PoE soon (currently about 45 hours in.)<br /><br />Update 3/25/16; I came close to finish PoE, but never got to the very end.  I decided that I want to play the game over again as a rogue, since none of your companion choice is one.  As I expected, I am pleased to see that when playing as a rogue, I discovered secrets that only a rogue can find -- This is what a wonderful PCRPG can do if you are a diehard fan like I am.n move at a time and you have very little control over which character to move first in combat.  - Last but certainly not Least -- To DRM or not to DRM ???
