I was very excited when Gazillion decided to provide G through Amazon. I often use to wonder why it wasn't so. Well now it is and you can also purchase this using Amazon.com Gift Cards. You must login to the Marvel Heroes website. Go to your profile and click redeem key. Put the code you acquired from Amazon.com and your G will be in game. I personally did this and did not login to the game until after redeeming the code. Just incase it may cause a delay.
