Is a unique game but would recommend watching the watchdogs forums if you really want this game and wait until most of the issues have been fixed.<br /><br />Pros:<br /> Unique Gameplay<br /><br />Cons:<br /> Tends to be laggy for most even with a good video card<br /> Game feels like it is intended for console when you try using mouse and keyboard (plays ok with 360 controller)<br /> Arcadish feel when driving<br /> Multiplayer is lacking
