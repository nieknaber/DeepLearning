If you liked Sniper Elite V2 than you will like this game as well. This is not a game that you can go through and just start shooting without thinking tactically. If you do you will die extremely fast. This is the kind of game that you have to think about when it’s best to avoid the enemy or where you need to make a shot from and how you’re going to conceal your shot. I love the fact that you have to have to pay attention to how far you’re shooting and the wind direction and strength. It’s not just a point and shoot game. I have not completed the game yet but each level has been taking me around 2 or 3 hours each to complete on Sniper Elite level and that’s basically medium difficulty. That’s a big relief for me since most games take maybe 6 or 7 hours of game play to finish the entire game.
