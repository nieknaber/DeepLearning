Developed by TimeGate Studios and published in 2009/2011, Section 8/Section 8 Prejudice is a first-person shooter video game. Section 8's story centers on Alex Corde, a space marine soldier in the 8th Armored Infantry who must lead his team against a rebel group named the Arm of Orion who are attempting to overthrow the current galactic government. Corde and his team must traverse different planets and environments to complete objective based missions (hacking computers, defending convoys, destroying supply depots etc.) and stop the Arm of Orion. Here are my thoughts on Section 8 and Section 8: Prejudice;<br /><br />Pros<br /><br />+ Great graphics and smooth frame rates.<br /><br />+ Fantastic soundtrack by Jason Graves (Dead Space, Silent Hunter, City of Heroes - Going Rogue).<br /><br />+ Good blend of vehicle and foot missions.<br /><br />+ Boost run, Repair Tool, Jet Pack and Auto-Target Locking skills.<br /><br />+ Excellent voice acting.<br /><br />+ Free-falls into drop zones are always fun to watch.<br /><br />Cons<br /><br />- Restricted Area Shutdown in 5 seconds. I can't even begin to tell you how much I absolutely despised this in both games! That's fine if I'm not supposed to have access to a certain areas but how about this....put up an invisible wall or at least give me more than 5 seconds to turn around and return to the mission area. You simply don't move fast enough without boost to make it back into the mission area. Failing to do so results in instant death. Simply an AWFUL mechanic.<br /><br />- Needed more use of vehicles and mechs. (See the Halo series)<br /><br />- Game uses Windows Live and only saves progress if you're logged in.<br /><br />- Some areas of uneven difficulty resulting in numerous respawns.<br /><br />- Stealth option is all but pointless except in Multi-player.<br /><br />- Too short at 4-6 hours each game playing through Single Player.<br /><br />- Thin storyline.<br /><br />Section 8 and Section 8: Prejudice are affordable and well-made First Person Shooter's. The graphics are decent, the gameplay is tight, the voice acting is well polished and the musical score it impressive. Unfortunately, the solid multiplayer of the game lacks players and the single player campaign is short and was a bit of a letdown. Combine this with a rather generic and transparent storyline and you get a pretty average experience overall. But, for the current price (I purchased both titles on Steam) of both titles I was satisfied with what the game had to offer. If you're looking for an inexpensive multiplayer game with a brief single player campaign as an addition then the Section 8 series is worth checking out.e and well-made First Person Shooter's.
