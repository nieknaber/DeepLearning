I got this during the steam summer sale for $18! And it all works great. I activated it all via steam and have most of them on backlog except rome and shogun which I play ocassionally. Other than that the bundle is a great for TBS, RTS people who like the genre. Rome helps you get started and Shogun helps further your enjoyment. I doubt I would buy this for $80 though. If your gonna buy a creative assembly game go for the new TW: Rome 2!
