Before you buy this just be aware that this nor any of Vlambeer's games currently work with Windows 8. In fact, any games made in GameMaker have problems with Windows 8, usually ending up with a sudden crash, it's unavoidable. As I have yet to play the game, I rated it how I think I'd enjoy judging by the videos I have watched on it.
