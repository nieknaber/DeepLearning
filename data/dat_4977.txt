Single player game requires always on internet connection. This never made since from the beginning. I don't write many reviews but this game should have never shipped.<br /><br />I played the game itself and it was awesome, fun, and a time sink. EA killed it with the always online, DRM, draconian features that the crazy CEO decided were a must to prevent pirating. CLEARLY YOU WERE WRONG. This encourages HONEST customers to pirate.<br /><br />Can't wait for EA to see several class action lawsuits over this game.
