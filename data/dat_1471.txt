By far the best dragon age game. Vast worlds free to explore at your leisure. Many of the sequeal games lacked that special feeling the original Dragon age had. This one brings it and then some. I found myself in tingles by some of the story mode unlocked. This game delves away from the traditional game engine that all prior games pretty much stuck to, so there might be some player adjusting, but the detail, graphics and story had that EPIC quest feeling.
