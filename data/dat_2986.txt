Bioshock infinite is a completely different from previous Bioshock games.  A whole new world has been created in the clouds that draws you in and keeps you glued to the computer.  Gameplay is excellent, controls are easy to learn, and visuals are simply outstanding, especially the color pallet.  This is a game that requires someone who has a couple hours at a time because it is so engaging.  I have played and played this game 3 times over, and plan to play again very soon.  This is the best game I have played all year.  I hightly recommend to all who love complex shooters.  By the way, the game requires a very powerful system to get the most out of the gameplay and graphics.
