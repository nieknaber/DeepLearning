the only downside is the framerate per second if you dont have enough graphics processing power. compared to all mmorpg's i've played with so far, FFXIV also has the best lighting, and water animation. you'll love the game world too! best thing is that it has some cool carribean and asian-themed areas, unlike LOTRO where it has to be only limited to the LOTR books.<br /><br />minor con, draggin/moving items is not well polished unlike most RPGs but i can bear it most of the time x)
