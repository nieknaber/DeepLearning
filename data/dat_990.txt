I really like this game.  If you hated FFXI, like I did, this game is nothing like that.  I joke with my husband that even though we both play this game we play two different games.  He plays end game raid stuff and I tradeskill and we are both happy with the game.  Tradeskilling in this game is better than in many MMOs.
