I don't see why the originals needed to be updated.  I played MI and MI2 way back when and loved em.  The first one had all this silence in it, and music only at certain parts.  That was fine.  MI2 had music all the time, which was obviously very meticulously planned, coz it fit perfectly.      The blockiness of the characters provided an ESSENTIAL part to the humor, which was the quasi-deadpan nature of it all.  The mannerisms of MI2 Guybrush when pointing to a door saying \\"let me see your files\\", or flipping his wig when seeing a fake LeChuck at a Mardi Gras party...or looking at the viewer in MI saying \\"what a buncha lazy pigs.\\"...I applaud Lucasarts for attempting something new with the sequels, and the Special Editions, but this is a series that did NOT need cartoony spaghetti characters (Guybrush looked tough enough in MI2, but was still a poser dork...he did not need to be made to look like a gangly freak) and did not need voiceovers.      So, the only appeal to me on these Special Editions is the new music and the nice backgrounds.  I am so glad you can turn the voices off.
