I've loved Simcity ever since Simcity 2000, so of course I had to buy the new edition of the Simcity franchise. There are still a few kinks that need to be resolved, but definitely better then the debacle when the game was first released. I am looking forward to the new update (update 10), which will hopefully address a few key areas of interest for many, myself included. The addition of a modding community, offline mode and hopefully in the near future, if not by EA, then hopefully a modder, larger maps. All are of course welcomed additions to the game.<br /><br />As for the expansion of Cities of Tomorrow, I highly recommend it to those looking to expand their Simcity experience. Cities of Tomorrow brings new buildings, including Mega Towers, The Academy, and of course Omega Co. A new disaster Outworlder 6. As well as a plethora of other buildings for parks, futuristic buildings, the maglev station, as well as new utility buildings.<br /><br />*** Word of Caution*** This version of the expansion for Simcity: Cities of Tomorrow, does NOT include the Cyclops Roller Coaster crown for the Mega Tower. However, you can buy Simcity: Cities of Tomorrow on the official Simcity website and that should include the coaster crown. At last check it was on sale for $20.99 instead of $29.99.
