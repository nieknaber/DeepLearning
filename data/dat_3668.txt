I've been a real time strategy gamer since I can remember but a game such as this is hard to find even though you never thought it would be good or even existed. Awesome story to a game that needs to be brought back to the present in a newer engine and light. From the story to the gameplay, World in Conflict is a piece of strategy history that will always have room no matter what.
