This was a fun game to play. It was not easy to defeat all of the enemies. It is more of a challenge than Beetle Bug 3 was.<br />I just replayed Beetle Bug 3 and was disappointed in it. There are three games in the series: Beetle Bug, 2, and 3. Amazon is one of a view places that have Beetle Bug for download.
