I am not a huge fan of first person shooters and that is what this game is.  I only tried the first few scenes of this demo, but was soon bored by just the point and shoot aspect of the game play.  I am sure that as the story gets more involved, so too would the interest in the game be amplified.  The graphics were pretty good, though a bit too \\"grained\\" out at times, which made it difficult to know where to shoot, or who you are shooting at.  Music was good and that always makes for a better gaming experience.  My reason for the low rating was based on my limited game play and I apologize to those who may love this game after playing through the entire story.
