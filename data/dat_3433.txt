Picked this up on sale for $5 and it was a good game for that price. Very well made with a large player base and a development team that actually seems to listen to the players.  Starting out using this Starter Pack really helped since one of the bonus items really speeds up your skill learning times.<br /><br />Recommended for anyone looking for a good MMO to get lost in.
