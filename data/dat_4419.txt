Can't recommend this one.  Lower quality painted graphics, silly or inexplicable mini-games, the not unusual saccharine love story (only entertaining part is that they met online!,  the not uncommon juxtaposition of serious situations and mortal danger mixed with 'oh, what girl doesn't love a walk-in closet' sorts of remarks, but worst of all are some poorly edited HO and other word labeling.  A door that actually lead to a Wardrobe was, when locked, called &#34;acid&#34;, a Hairbrush to find turned out to be a comb, and what is a APOTÐ˜K? - It apparently is a dart.  There was also some unheard of name for an 8-ball.  These and other careless naming of items make it frustrating to continue.  Since there are AFAIK no Walkthroughs nor any professional reviews (and precious few user reviews) online, you're on your own with this one.  Even at 2.99, I not at all sure it was worth it.
