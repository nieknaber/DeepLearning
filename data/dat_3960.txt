Wonderful game, honestly was looking back at this game and found myself trying to play the game again and thought I should review it. However I never got to playing it again due to the long corridor type missions that only intrigue if you do not know what is coming next. Personally for me the replay ability value for this game is low but a definite must if you enjoy role playing, science fiction, or adventure games. The gameplay system is alright but that is not the main draw to either this franchise or this game. I started playing this game after playing halfway through Mass Effect 2 and realizing I was inspired to get to know the back story since I didn't understand some of the stuff that was going on. If you haven't played this series already I highly recommend it for it's story.
