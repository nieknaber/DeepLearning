This is absolutely the best way to purchase Xbox Live. You save money, you don't deal with XBL support, you don't need to worry having info in your system, no hassles of renewing or cancellations, no calling, no need to drive and purchase a card, etc...<br /><br />The code is available almost immediately after purchasing once you select the 'online game code option'. No hassles at all. People giving this anything under than 5stars do not understand how XBL works and even some complaints are not even related to this. This is about buying an XBL card, that is all.
