[Disclosure: I have participated in the six-week beta and have clocked two hours in the game, I plan to clock more into it later as I find it entertaining]<br /><br />I know what you're thinking; &#34;just a Minecraft ripoff&#34;, or &#34;horrid MC&#34; but it's not; Blockstorm is a first-person shooter, yes; those are common but they have Minecraft elements combined with elements from Counter-Strike, but with digging and even iron sights although you may not be a fan of iron sights if you're an &#34;arena shooter&#34; fan (sprinting isn't included though). Anyway, Blockstorm is a first-person shooter which allows players to fight in a voxel battlefield where they fight against each other as their own avatars and with their own weapon skins which can all be downloaded freely from the Steam Workshop so you can have sweet-looking guns and be able to play as characters like Finn from Adventure Time, a Star Wars Clone Stormtrooper, Dallas from Payday, Sonic, Bender from Futurama, the possibilities are pretty endless and even better; there's even custom maps to be played and guess what?<br /><br />No microtransactions, no boosters, no paying $200 for a knife skin even, you just pay up front and you get to have fun with custom content for free and that's part of what makes it great.<br /><br />A good part of the game is that there aren't RPG elements that are now commonplace in modern shooters so you have full access to all weapons and can change your loadout anytime. Switch from grenades to RPG? Alright. Want an Uzi instead of a pistol? Go for it. Everyone is on an equal playing field, especially because perks are nonexistent, it's all skill-based.<br /><br />There are various kinds of game modes, and they have variety; although I want to see more added in later updates. You got your deathmatch, team deathmatch and capture the flag but there's also an invasion kind of game mode (Assault) and there's even one where you have to steal the team's loot (Castle something), there are others like Hunt and all that stuff but I have hopes that they add more game modes in later updates; because that'd be sweet, maybe add Infection and VIP for example.<br /><br />And if you are looking for vehicles; I'm sorry, no vehicles can be driven but it isn't much of a problem unless you really are a fan of vehicles but considering the map structure, I don't really mind it.<br /><br />Pros:<br />-All additional content, community-driven is free.<br />-No need to pay for cosmetic skins.<br />-No RPG elements commonplace in modern shooters.<br />-Almost infinite-customization of weapons and characters.<br />-Active player base.<br /><br />Cons:<br />-More game modes should be added, maybe Infection kind of game modes and VIP.<br />-Lack of vehicles; but the map structure doesn't really need vehicles.<br /><br />Final score: 9.0/10 - Buy it
