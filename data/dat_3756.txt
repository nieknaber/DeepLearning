I played the original Test Drive Unlimited and enjoyed it despite its bugs and quirks, so I bought TDU 2 hoping Atari had improved the game. They have, for the most part, although the decision to force players to take driving tests in order to race was asinine. But, forget that--I got through them and have competed in most of the races.     What really irks me about Atari and this game in particular is the Casino downloadable content that they offer. They sell it on their website if you can get past the bugs. I've been at it about a month, but the site still doesn't realize that I entered and saved the credit card info required to buy the add-on ages ago. I called their support, and their representatives couldn't access their website either! These people may put out good games on occasion, but Heaven help you if you need support or want to purchase add-ons. Atari is a perfect example of a software company run by idiots. They are hopeless. One can only hope another software company will buy them out.
