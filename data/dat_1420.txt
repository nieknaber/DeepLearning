I've had a Runescape membership before, but I paid for it straight from Jagex. I bought this membership. Worst. Mistake. Ever.<br /><br />After I bought it and my money was removed from my card, I tried to log into a member's world. I was greeted with a sign that said something along the lines of, &#34;You are not a member. Purchase a subscription to log into this world.&#34;<br /><br />There is no way for me to get my money back, and I'm pretty upset. I was so excited to be a member again. They stole my $8. Next time (if there is one), I'll be sure to buy a membership straight from runescape.
